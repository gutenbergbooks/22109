<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>After numerous visits to a number of remote
and unfrequented places in the Rocky
Mountains, from Wyoming to Alberta, the
writer was deeply impressed with the awesome
mystery of the wilderness and the weird
legends he heard around the camp fires,
while the bigness of the things he saw was
photographed on his brain so distinctly and
permanently as to act as a compelling force
causing him, aye, almost forcing him to write
about it.</p>

<p>When the spell came upon him, like the
Ancient Mariner, he needs must tell the story,
and thus the tale of the Black Wolf Pack was
written with no thought, at the time, of
publishing the narrative, but primarily for
the real enjoyment the author derived from
writing it, and also for the entertainment of
the author&#8217;s family and intimate friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>The tale, however, pleased the members of
the Editorial Board of the Boy Scouts of
America, and Mr. Franklin K. Mathiews,
Chief Scout Librarian, asked permission to
have it edited for the Scout Magazine, which
request was cheerfully granted.</p>

<p>The author hereby freely and cheerfully
acknowledges the useful changes and practical
suggestions injected into the story by his
friend and associate, Mr. Irving Crump,
Editor of Boys&#8217; Life, in which magazine the
Black Wolf Pack, in somewhat abbreviated
form, first appeared.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p>It was a terrible shock to me (said the
Scoutmaster as he fingered a beaded buckskin
bag). Old Blink Broosmore was responsible.
It was a malicious thing for him to do.
He meant it to be mean, too,&mdash;wanted to
hurt me,&mdash;to wound my feelings and make
me ashamed. And all because he nursed a
grudge against dad&mdash;I mean Mr. Crawford.</p>

<p>It started because of that defective spark-plug
in the engine of the roadster. Strange
what a tiny thing such as a crack in a porcelain
jacket around an old spark-plug can do in the
way of changing the course of a fellow&#8217;s whole
life.</p>

<p>My last period in the afternoon at high
school was a study period and I cut it because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
I had several things to do down town. I
hurried home and took the roadster, and on
my way out mother&mdash;I mean Mrs. Crawford&mdash;gave
me an armful of books to return to the
library and a list of errands she wanted me to
do. While motoring down town I noticed
that one cylinder was missing occasionally
and I told myself I would change that spark-plug
as soon as I got home.</p>

<p>I made all the stops I had planned and
even drove around to the church because I
wanted to look in at the parish house where
some of my scouts (I was the assistant scoutmaster
of Troop 6, of Marlborough) were
putting up decorations for the very first
Fathers and Sons dinner ever given which we
were to have on Washington&#8217;s birthday.
That was in 1911.</p>

<p>As I was leaving I looked at my new wrist
watch and discovered that it was a quarter
of five.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just in time to catch dad and drive him
home from the office,&#8221; I said to myself, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
I knew that he left the office of his big paper-mill
down at the docks at five o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>I jumped into the car and bowled along
down Spring Street and the Front Street hill
and arrived at the mill office at exactly five.
Dad wasn&#8217;t in sight so I decided to turn around
and wait for him at the curb. That is how
the trouble started. I got part way around
on the hill when that cylinder began missing
a lot and next thing I knew the motor stalled
and there was I with my car crosswise on the
hill, blocking traffic&mdash;and traffic is heavy on
Front Street hill about five o&#8217;clock, because
all the mills are rushing their trucks down to
the piers with the last loads of merchandise
before the down-river boats leave, at six
o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>In about two minutes I was holding up a
line of trucks a block long and those drivers
were saying a lot of things that were not very
complimentary to me and not printed in
Sunday-school papers. And old Blink Broosmore
was right up at the head of the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
with a truck load of cases from the box factory
and the look on his face was about as ugly
as a mud turtle&#8217;s. Then, to make matters
worse, my starter wouldn&#8217;t work at the
critical moment, and I had to get out to crank
the engine. What a howl of indignation went
up from those stalled truck drivers! I felt
like a bad two-cent piece in a drawer full of
five-dollar gold pieces. Guess my face was
red behind my ears.</p>

<p>And then old Blink made the unkindest
remark of all&mdash;no, he didn&#8217;t make it to me;
he just yelled it out to a couple of other truck-drivers.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what happens with these make-believe
dudes,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
kid old Skin Flint Crawford took out of an
orphan asylum. He&#8217;s a kid that old
Crawford took up with because he was too
mean t&#8217; have t&#8217; Lord bless him with one o&#8217;
his own. That&#8217;s straight, fellers. I was
Crawford&#8217;s gardener when it happened an&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Blink stopped and got red and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
white, and I could see the other truck men
looking uncomfortable. I looked up and
there was Dad Crawford on the curb boring
holes into Blink with those cold gray eyes of
his and looking as white as marble. No one
said a word. It seemed as if the whole street
became hushed and silent. I got the car
around to the curb somehow and dad got in
and the line of trucks trundled by with every
driver looking straight ahead and some of
them grinning nervously and apparently feeling
mighty uncomfortable.</p>

<p>But that wasn&#8217;t a patch to the way I felt,
and I could see by the lack of color and set
expression of dad&#8217;s face and the way he stared
straight ahead of him without saying a word
that he was feeling very unhappy about it too.
There was something behind it all&mdash;something
that raised in my mind vague doubts and
very unpleasant thoughts.</p>

<p>Dad never spoke a word all the way home,
and, needless to say, I did not either&mdash;I
couldn&#8217;t; my whole world seemed to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
turned upside down in the space of half an
hour. Was it true that I was not Donald
Crawford? Was it possible that Alexander
Crawford, this fine, big, broad-shouldered,
kindly man beside me was not my real father?
Was it a fact that that noble, generous, happy
woman whom I called mamma was not my
mother at all? Each of those questions took
shape in my mind and each was like a stab
in the heart, for Blink Broosmore had answered
them all, and Alexander Crawford, though he
must know how anxious I was to have Blink
denied, did not speak to refute him.</p>

<p>We rolled up the drive and dad stepped
out, still silent, but he did smile wistfully at
me as he closed the car door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it away, Don, and hurry in for dinner,&#8221;
he said and I felt certain I detected a break
in his voice. I felt sorry&mdash;sorry for him and
sorry for myself, and as I put the car in the
garage, I had a hard time trying to see things
clearly; my eyes would get blurred and a lump
would get into my throat in spite of me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>As I dressed for dinner I felt half dazed.
I hardly realized what I was doing, and I had
to stop and pull myself together before I
started downstairs to the dining room, for
I knew if I did not have myself well in hand I
would blubber like a big chump.</p>

<p>Mother and dad were waiting for me and
I could see by mother&#8217;s sad expression and
the troubled look in her eyes that dad had
told her of the whole occurrence. And that
only added to my unhappiness because I
felt for a certainty that all that Blink Broosmore
had shouted must be true.</p>

<p>For the first time in my memory dad
forgot to say grace, and none of us ate with
any apparent relish and none of us tried to
make conversation. It was a painful sort of
a meal and I wanted to have it over with as soon
as I could. It seemed hours before Nora
cleared the table and served dad&#8217;s demi-tasse.</p>

<p>I guess I then looked him full in the eyes
for the first time since the occurrence on
Front Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>&#8220;That was a very unkind thing for Blink
Broosmore to do,&#8221; said dad, and I knew by
the firmness and evenness of his voice that
he had gained full control of his feelings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is&mdash;oh, did he tell the truth, dad?&#8221;
I gulped helplessly and for the life of me I
could not keep back the tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, Donald, there is just
enough truth in it to make it hurt,&#8221; said dad
and I could see mother wince as if she had
been struck, and turn away her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;They why&mdash;why? Oh! who am I?&#8221; I
cried, for the whole thing had completely
unnerved me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don dear, we do not know to a certainty,&#8221;
said mother struggling with her emotions.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now that you are partly aware of the
situation, I think there is a way you can find
out, at least as much as we know,&#8221; said dad,
getting up and going into the library.</p>

<p>Through the doorway I could see him
fumbling at the safe that he kept there beside
the desk. Presently he drew out a battered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and dented red tin box and a bundle of papers.
These he brought into the dining room and
laid on the table. Then he drew up a chair,
cleared his throat, rather loudly it seemed to
me, and began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don, we always wanted a child, and why
the Lord never blessed us with one of our own
we do not know. Anyway, we wanted one
so badly that we decided to adopt one. That
was seventeen years ago, wasn&#8217;t it, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor Raymond, the physician at the
county institution, knew our desires and,
being an old friend of the family, he volunteered
to find us a good healthy baby that we
could adopt and call our own. Not a week
later you appeared on the scene. Dr. Raymond
told us that a wagon drawn by a raw-boned
horse, and loaded with household
goods, drew up to the orphanage and a tired
and worn-out looking old lady got out with a
lusty year old child in one arm and this box
and these papers under the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>&#8220;At the office of the asylum she explained
how she and her husband were moving from
a Connecticut town to a little farm they had
bought in Pennsylvania. Somewhere at a
crossroad near Derby, Connecticut, they had
found the baby and this box and bundle of
papers in a basket under a bush with a card
attached to the basket requesting that the
finder adopt and take care of the baby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, they could not pass the infant
by, but the woman explained that they were
too poor and too old to adopt the child so they
had gone miles out of their way to find an
orphanage and leave the baby there, along
with the box and papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Dr. Raymond heard the story and
saw you, for you were the baby, he got me on
the telephone and told me all about you.
And that night he brought you here, and
you were such a chubby, bright, interesting
little fellow that mother and I fell in love with
you immediately and decided to adopt you,
which we did according to law. So you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
our legal child, Don, and all that, although
we are not your real parents.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somehow that made me feel a little happier.
Dad and mother did have a claim on me at
least. That was something.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not until after Dr. Raymond had
left,&#8221; went on father, &#8220;that mother and
I examined the box and papers that had come
with you. Here they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dad took up a worn and age-yellowed envelope
addressed in a bold hand:</p>

<p class="center">To the Finder</p>

<p class="noindent">Inside was the following brief message:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">To the Finder</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>The mother of this child, Donald Mullen,
is dead. I, his father, cannot give him the
care he should have. Will you, the finder,
adopt him, care for him, and bring him up to
be an honest, trustworthy man, and win the
eternal gratitude of his dead mother and</p>

<p class="signature1">
<span class="smcap">Donald Mullen</span>,</p>
<p class="writer">his father.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Then my name is&mdash;or was Mullen,&#8221; I
exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>&#8220;According to that,&#8221; said dad softly, &#8220;but
when you became our son we kept your first
name and discarded the family name of
course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but what has become of my father,
Donald Mullen?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy, we have tried both for your sake
and for our own to find out. We have followed
up and searched every possible clue
and&mdash;but wait, here are other papers of
interest and after you have read them I will
tell you all we have done to locate your real
father and afterwards we will talk the whole
situation over.&#8221; As dad was speaking he
passed over the battered tin box. On the
lid was inscribed the simple lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>The contents of this box belong to the boy.
If you are honest you will see that it comes
into his hands at the proper time. If you
are dishonest, then God help the boy and
God help you!</p>

<p class="signature">
<span class="smcap">D. Mullen.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It was some time before I could make up
my mind to force the lid. When I did the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
first thing that my eyes fell upon was this
buckskin bag of unmistakable Indian design,
beautifully decorated with bead work and
highly colored porcupine quills cunningly
worked into a good luck design. As I picked
up the bag I saw that it was sealed with wax
and to it was attached a card on which was
penned:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p class="noindent">To my son:&mdash;</p>

<p>Here is all the wealth I possess. It isn&#8217;t
much. The bag with its contents was sent
to me by my brother, Fay, who is out in the
Rockies. He gave it to me to pay my
expenses out there to join him. I am leaving
it for you. It may help you over some rocky
places if it ever gets into your hands, and I
trust the good Lord that it does.</p>

<p class="signature2">Lovingly,</p>
<p class="writer"><span class="smcap">Your Father.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The bag gave forth the unmistakable clink
of gold coins as I dropped it on the table.</p>

<p>That message from my father, whom I had
never seen, made my heart heavy and again
that lump gathered in my throat, for I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
feel the heartaches that the writing of that
note must have caused him. I had not the
courage to break the seal of the bag and
examine its contents. I pushed it aside and
took from the box another time-yellowed
envelope addressed to</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">My Son Donald</span><br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">Inside I found the following:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p class="noindent">Dear Boy:&mdash;</p>

<p>I cannot determine whether I am giving you
a mean deal or whether this is all for your
good. Your mother, Barbara Parker Mullen,
is dead, God bless her! She has been dead
now six months. It seems to me like eternity.
I have tried to take care of you as she would
have cared for you but I am afraid I have lost
heart, and my courage, and I am afraid my
faith has slipped from me. I fear that I am
a broken-spirited failure. The passing of
your mother has taken everything from me.
I am no longer fit or able to care for you and
I must pass you on to someone else and trust
your welfare to God. For neither your mother
nor I have any relatives left who are able to
take care of you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>What will become of you I cannot guess.
I can only hope for the best. But by the
time you are old enough to read and understand
this message you will, I hope, have
forgiven me or praised me for my effort to
find you a home.</p>

<p>What will become of me I do not know.
I have one brother left in the world, Fay
Mullen, and he is out in Piute Pass in the
Rockies grubbing for gold. I am going out
to join him for I know the only way I can
forget my grief and get hold of myself once
more is to bury myself in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Fay has sent me a bag of double eagles to
pay my expenses west. That is all the
money I have in the world. I am not going
to use it. I will work my way west and leave
the gold for you. It is the least and probably
the last that I can do for you.</p>

<p>If, when you read this you have any desires
to know who you really are, I will leave you
the following information:</p>

<p>Your mother, a wonderful woman, was
Barbara Parker of Litchfield, Connecticut,
daughter of Judge Arnold Parker of Litchfield,
now deceased. I am Donald Mullen,
the eldest of three brothers; Fay Mullen is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the next of age and Patrick Mullen, the gunsmith
of Maiden Lane, New York, is the
youngest. We were born in Byron Bridge,
Ireland, and we three came to this country
after our parents died. You come of an
honest, worthwhile people on my side, and of
the best American blood on your mother&#8217;s,
Donald, and I ask only that you live an honest,
honorable life and have faith in your country
and your God, and He will be with you to the
end.</p>

<p>Good-bye, boy.</p>
<p class="signature2">Lovingly,</p>
<p class="writer"><span class="smcap">Your Father.</span></p>
</div>

<p>I read the letter aloud but I confess that
my voice broke toward the end and I choked
up until reading was difficult.</p>

<p>For some time after I finished, we three sat
in silence. The thoughts and mental pictures
of that broken man parting with his baby son
seventeen years before made me most unhappy.</p>

<p>Dad broke the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now you are acquainted with the
whole situation, what do you think?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&#8221;&#8220;I scarcely know what to think,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;It does not appear natural for a man to
abandon his own son in the manner he did.
It seems heartless and cruel. I cannot understand
it; yet I wish I could see my poor
father. I wonder if he is still alive. Certainly
with the information at hand it should not
be impossible for me to trace him or some
relatives of my mother. Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I thought, Don, for when
you were three years old I began to wonder
about your father&#8217;s whereabouts. I wanted
to meet him and perhaps help him if I could.
Do not think that your poor father was cruel,
for it is evident that the man was suffering
from a nervous breakdown and consequently
more or less irresponsible; I think he acted
wonderfully well under the circumstances.
In order to help him I began a search and for
ten years I have had detectives and private
individuals following up every possible lead.
Yet, with all my efforts, the search has
amounted to nothing. Your father&#8217;s trail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
ended at a Spokane outfitting store. I could
not locate anyone nearer to you than an old
maiden great-aunt of your mother&#8217;s although
I have had every clue investigated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only relative of your father&#8217;s that
I could get any information about was his
youngest brother, Patrick Mullen, your uncle
and a famous gunsmith of Maiden Lane,
New York. He is dead now but his reputation
for making an exceptionally fine hand-forged
gun lives on even to-day. Patrick Mullen
died just before I began my search for your
father, but in digging around for facts about
him, I learned that he had made a limited
number of very fine guns, on each of which he
had stamped his full name, &#8216;Patrick Mullen.&#8217;
Other guns of an inferior quality that he made
bore the simple stamp of &#8216;P. Mullen.&#8217; The
old man was very proud of each &#8216;Patrick
Mullen&#8217; that he turned out and like the true
artist that he was he kept track of each one,
sold them only to men he knew and when the
owner died he bought the gun back himself so
that he always knew its whereabouts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>&#8220;In that way all of the 101 &#8216;Patrick
Mullen&#8217;s&#8217; he made came back to him, save
one. There is one of the complete number still
missing and no one seems to know where it is.
This is more remarkable because the missing
gun is a flint-lock rifle of the style of seventy
years ago. That gun has always struck me as
being a valuable clue in our search, because it
is the only rifle ever made by the old gunsmith
and I have a feeling that that missing &#8216;Patrick
Mullen&#8217; may have been given to your father
by the brother, and that may account for
the fact that among the papers of Patrick
Mullen there is no record of its whereabouts;
this is in a measure confirmed by the report
that the man outfitting at Spokane had a long
old-fashioned rifle, and collectors say there
used to be an expert in antique arms by the
name of Mullen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The suggestion made me tremendously
excited. Beyond a doubt in my mind that
missing &#8220;Patrick Mullen&#8221; was my father&#8217;s
gun. I imagined him parting with everything
else save the unique gun his famous brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
had made for him. Why he should wish for a
flint-lock rifle was an unanswerable question,
but someone wanted that sort of a gun or it
would not have been made, and my father&#8217;s
letters showed him to be a man of sentiment,
and impractical, just the sort of fellow to use a
flint-lock when he might just as well have
had a modern breech-loading high-power rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;ve hit it, dad. Hot dog!&#8221;
I exclaimed. &#8220;Bet a cookie that that gun
does belong to my father and if we can find it
we will probably find him too&mdash;would not that
be bully?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel the same way too, Don. But
finding that missing gun will be as difficult
as finding your father. I have searched the
country over for it and made a wonderful
collection of flint-lock guns, as you see by
looking at yonder gun-rack; I have had
dozens of arms collectors and detectives
looking for guns of that description, but no
Patrick Mullen rifle has turned up anywhere.
There have, of course, been many false clues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and many queer rifles offered to me and I
have put a great many thousands of dollars
into the search, and my collection of flint-locks
is the best in the land, Don. But so
far nothing but failures seem to have rewarded
my search&mdash;no, I&#8217;m wrong, there is one man
out west&mdash;out in the little jerk-water town of
Grave Stone, who insists that there is a wild
man living in a lonely, almost inaccessible
valley in the mountains, who shoots a gun
which looks like the one for which I am searching.
For a number of years this man of
mystery, it seems, has been appearing and
reappearing, according to Big Pete Darlinkel,
my informant, but even Pete has never got in
personal touch with this eccentric hermit.
Neither have several detectives I have sent
out there for that purpose. The detectives
seem to be all right in towns or cities and are
undoubtedly brave men, but something out
there appears to frighten them and they lose
interest the moment they cut the trail of the
wild hunter. I begin to think this wild man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
is a myth, too. Strange, though, that just a
week ago I received another letter from Pete
Darlinkel. Wait, I&#8217;ll find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned from the library presently with
a letter which he opened and passed over to
me. It read:</p>

<div class="letter">
<p class="noindent">
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Crawford</span>:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>Maybe you hain&#8217;t interested no more but
thet tha&#8217; ole Dopped ganger, the Wild
Hunter, the spooky old critter, has been seen
agin. i wuz on the top of the painted Butte
yesterday squinten one i in the valley look&#8217;n
for elk and look&#8217;n up with tother i for
Big horn on the mountain, when i staged the
old duffer snoop&#8217;en along in one of the parks
an&#8217; he had the same long hair and long rifle
he uster have. He sure is a ghost or else
he&#8217;s a nut or an old timer gone locoed. He
sends the chills down my backbone every
time i sots my eyes on him.</p>

<p class="signature1">Your obedients sarvent,</p>
<p class="writer"><span class="smcap">Big Pete.</span></p>
</div>

<p>There was something about that crude
letter that stirred me deeply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>Could this strange freak that Big Pete saw
from the top of the painted Butte possess that
Patrick Mullen rifle? If so did he know anything
about the whereabouts of my father?
It is not uncommon for people suffering from
a mental breakdown to flee to the country
or wilderness and there live the life of a
recluse, and from my father&#8217;s last letter it
was evident that he had had a nervous breakdown
from anxiety and brooding over the loss
of my mother, to whom he evidently was
devotedly attached. It might, therefore, be
possible that this strange, wild man himself
was my father, an unpleasant possibility.
At any rate, I felt that I could not rest, at
least until I discovered to a certainty the
name of the maker of the long rifle said to be
carried by the wild hunter and I told dad just
how I felt about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you would feel that way, son,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I have often wanted to go west
for the very same purpose and I knew that
when I told you everything you would want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
go too. I intended to lay all the facts before
you when you were twenty-one but now that
Blink Broosmore has taken it upon himself to
inform you and his truck-driving friends of
the mystery surrounding your real parentage,
I guess it is best you know all there is to be
known about the situation. The rest I&#8217;ll
leave to you. In fact, it would please me a
great deal if you would run down this last
vague clue to see if your father really is still
alive. Go, Donald, and God bless you, and
take that bag of gold with you, unopened,
for it may now stand your father in good stead,
and if you do find him, bring him here and I
promise you he will never want for a thing,
nor will you, my son, for you are still my boy
whatever your real parentage may be.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stage pulled up in front of a typical
western saloon, post office and general store.
There was the usual crowd of prospectors,
gamblers, cow punchers and trappers assembled
to meet the incoming stage. When
I scrambled off the top of the old-fashioned
coach, and before I had time to shake the
alkali dust from my clothes, or moisten my
dry and cracked lips, a typical western bully
approached me roaring the verses of a song
with which he evidently intended to terrify me,</p>

<p class="poem">
&#8220;He blowed into Lanigan swinging a gun<br />
A new one,<br />
A blue one,<br />
A colt&#8217;s forty-one,<br />

On the sage brush shore,<br />
An&#8217; he shot a big hole&mdash;&#8221;
</p>

<p>He got no further with the song. Another
man stepped out from the crowd, a very
tall, powerful man who would have attracted
attention in any garb in any place by his
distinguished appearance, who with little ceremony
rudely brushed the roughneck to one side,
and my instinct told me the handsome
stranger could be no other than Big Pete
Darlinkel.</p>

<p>My! my! what a man he was! Looked as if
he just stepped out of one of Fred Remington&#8217;s
pictures, or Buffalo Bill&#8217;s Wild West
Show, or slipped from between the leaves
of a volume of Captain Mayne Reid&#8217;s
&#8220;Scalp Hunters&#8221;&mdash;Big Pete was evidently a
hold-over from another age. He would have
fitted perfectly and with nicety in a picture
of Davy Crockett&#8217;s men down in old Texas.
He seemed, however, perfectly at home in this
border town, and I noted that the most hard-boiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and toughest men in the crowd treated
him with marked respect and deference.</p>

<p>Pete was a wilderness fop and a dandy, and
evidently was as careful of his clothes as a
West Point cadet. In dress he affected the
old-fashioned picturesque garb of the mountains.
His appearance filled me with wonder
and admiration; he stood six feet two or
three inches in his moccasins, straight as an
arrow and lithe as a cat.</p>

<p>His costume consisted of a tunic of dressed
deer skin, smoked to the softness of the
finest flannels. He wore it belted in at the
waist, but open at the breast and throat
where it fell back like a sailor&#8217;s collar into a
short cape covering the shoulders. Underneath
was the undershirt of dressed fawn skin;
his leggins and moccasins were of the same
material as his hunting shirt, and on his head
he wore a fox skin cap; the fox&#8217;s head adorned
with glass eyes ornamented the front and the
tail hung like a drooping plume over the left
shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>Big Pete Darlinkel was a blonde, and his
golden hair hung in sunny curls upon his
massive shoulders; a light mustache, soft yellow
beard, with a pair of the deepest, clearest,
most innocent baby-like blue eyes, all made a
face such as an angel might have after years of
exposure to sun and wind.</p>

<p>Not only are Big Pete&#8217;s revolvers gold
mounted, but the shaft of his keen-edged
knife is rich with figures, rings, and stars
filed from gold coins and set in the horn.
The very stock of his long, single-barreled
rifle is inlaid like an Arab&#8217;s gun, and, as for
his buckskin hunting suit, it is a mass of
embroidery and colored quills from his beaded
moccasins to the fringed cape of his shirt.</p>

<p>Big Pete was a dandy, fond of color, fond of
display; yet in spite of all this he wore absolutely
nothing for decoration alone, but every
article of use about his person was ornamented
to an oriental degree. Gaudy and
rich as his costume was when viewed in detail,
as a whole it harmonized not only with Pete,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
his hair, his complexion, his weapons, but
with whatever natural objects surrounded him.</p>

<p>Big Pete also seemed to know me instinctively
and approached with a graceful and
swinging step; holding out his hand he greeted
me in a low, soft, well-modulated voice with,
&#8220;Howdy, kid; yes, I&#8217;m Big Pete and allow you
are the tenderfoot dude from New York
what wants to shoot big game, an&#8217; reckon
you&#8217;d like to meet the wild mountain man?
Well, he&#8217;s a queer one, I tell you. He&#8217;s got
us all buffaloed out this-a-way, most of us
don&#8217;t care to meet him close up and we give
him wide range when we cut his trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was Big Pete&#8217;s greeting. Of course,
I had not told him of my real interest in this
mysterious man of the mountains, only suggesting
that I would like to do some big game
shooting and see the spooky hunter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;I would like to get a
record elk head to take home to dad. As for
the mountain wildman, I wish you&#8217;d tell me
more about him, he is awfully interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>&#8220;Tell you more? Well, sho, I reckon I can
tell you more than most people round these
parts for he makes my game park his stampin&#8217;
grounds every onct in a while, an&#8217; let me tell
you he hunts some peculiar, he do, he&#8217;s half
man and half wolf&mdash;but shucks, I won&#8217;t spoil
the show, you will see how he hunts for yourself
if you stay here long. Glory be, but he&#8217;s
got me some bashful and shy. But mosey
along and I&#8217;ll hist yore stuff on this here
cayuse while you let them tha&#8217; dogs out of
their chicken coop boxes. You can cache
your dude duds in the Emporium general store
over yonder next to Squinty Quinn&#8217;s saloon,
an&#8217; then we&#8217;re off for the hills. I&#8217;ll yarn about
this Wild Hunter while we hit the trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour spent in Grave Stone gave me an
opportunity to wash myself and change my
clothes for some that would be more substantial
for out-of-door wear, start several letters
east telling of my safe arrival, buy the things
I had overlooked, store my surplus clothes
with the postmaster at the general store, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
repack my kit for pony travel. Then, after
watching Big Pete skilfully throw the diamond
hitch, we were off for the hills and our first
camp. I hoped that I was on my way to find
my real father and unravel the mystery that
surrounded my strange babyhood. But I
little guessed what adventures I was to have
or the strange things I was to see before my
quest was ended.</p>

<p>We traveled fast all the remaining portion
of the afternoon and toward evening we made
camp and for the first time in my life I slept
under the sky. At the end of the fifth day
we reached the secret and narrow opening of
a big valley or &#8220;park&#8221; in the midst of a wild
tumble of mountains. Big Pete said we
would pitch our tent in the park.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tha&#8217;s plenty of signs &#8217;round too an&#8217; if we
loosen t&#8217; dogs p&#8217;raps we kin stir up a mountain
lion or collar some fresh meat t&#8217; start camp
with,&#8221; said he as he slid off his horse and took
the leashes off the dogs.</p>

<p>It took us but a short time to arrange our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
camp, then Big Pete followed by the frisking
dogs slipped silently into the woods. He was
gone scarcely a quarter of an hour when he
reappeared again without the dogs, motioned
for me to get my gun and follow him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tha&#8217;s elk signs all bout,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an&#8217;
the muts broke away on a fresh trail. Now
you an&#8217; me&#8217;ll climb through that draw yonder
and hide out on the runway till they drive an
elk in gun shot. Come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>I followed eagerly and presently we had
climbed through a thickly grown poplar
grove and found a suitable hiding place among
the small poplars. We had the wind right
and a clear view of most of the open park.
Big Pete stooped down and motioned for me
to do likewise.</p>

<p>I quietly crouched beside him and waited&mdash;waited
until my legs were cramped, waited
until the dampness from the moss struck
through the heavy soles of my tenderfoot
shoes and chilled my feet; waited until my
arm was so numb that it felt like a piece of
lead&mdash;then, in spite of the danger of incurring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Big Pete&#8217;s displeasure and in spite of my
dread of being thought a dude tenderfoot,
I changed my position, rubbed life into my
arm and assumed an easier pose.</p>

<p>In front of us was a small lake, deep, dark
and unruffled. All around the edge was a
natural wharf formed from the gigantic trunks
of trees which had fallen for ages into the lake
and been washed by wind and waves and
forced by winter ice into such regular order
and position along the shore that their arrangement
looked like the work of men.
Back of this wharf and all about was the wilderness
of silent wood; a wilderness enclosed
by a wall of mountains, whose lofty heads
were uplifted far above the soft white clouds
that floated in the blue sky overhead and
were mirrored in the lake below. An eagle,
on apparently immovable wings, soared over
the lake in spiral course. As I watched the
bird its wings seemed suddenly endowed with
life. At the same instant my guide gave a low
grunt of warning.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; I asked in a whisper, for there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
was a strange expression in my companion&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s him, so help me!&mdash;Keep yer ears
open and yer meat-trap shut!&#8221; growled Pete.</p>

<p>I did so. The trained ear of the hunter had
detected the sound of crackling twigs and swishing
branches made by some animals in rapid
motion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;the dogs. You
startled me; I thought it was Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish it was nothing wuss,&#8221; muttered my
guide, as he examined his weapons with a
critical eye and loosened the cartridges for
his revolvers in his belt to make sure that
they would be easy to pluck out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those hain&#8217;t our dogs, mister,&#8221; he remarked
after he had examined his whole arsenal.</p>

<p>As I again fixed my attention on the noise,
in place of the resonant voice of the hounds,
I heard nothing but the crackling of branches,
with an occasional half-suppressed wolf-like
yelp.</p>

<p>Big Pete turned pale and muttered, &#8220;It&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
them for sartin; it&#8217;s them agin! And I hain&#8217;t
been drinkin&#8217;, nuther!&#8221;</p>

<p>Big Pete Darlinkel remained crouching in
exactly the same pose he had first assumed,
but his face looked sallow and worn. I marveled.
Was this big westerner really awed
by the situation we were facing? What disaster
impended?</p>

<p>My guide&#8217;s eyes were fixed upon an opening
in the woods and I knew that something would
soon bound from that spot. I could hear the
crashing of brush and half-suppressed wolf-like
yelps, followed by a pause, then a rushing
noise, and out leaped as beautiful a bull elk
as I had ever seen&mdash;in fact the first I had ever
seen at close range in his native wilderness.
I had only time to take note of his muscular
neck, clean cut limbs, his grand branching
antlers, and&mdash;not my dogs but a pack of
<i>immense black wolves</i> at his heels before I
instinctively brought my gun to my shoulder.
But before I could draw a bead Big Pete
struck it, knocking the muzzle up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>&#8220;Hist!&#8221; he exclaimed, pointing to the bird.</p>

<p>The eagle screamed, descended like a thunderbolt
and skilfully avoiding the branching
antlers, struck the bull, driving one talon into
the neck and the other into the back, flapping
its huge wings as it tore with its beak at the
body of the elk like a trained &#8220;<i>bear coote</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was thunderstruck. The evident partnership
of the wolves and bird needed explanation
and it was not long in coming. A shrill
whistle pierced the air, the black wolves
immediately ceased to worry the elk, the eagle
soared overhead, and for an instant the elk
stood confused, then leaped high in the air and
fell dead. The next moment I heard the
crack of a rifle and saw a puff of blue smoke
across the lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no ghost,&#8221; I said, when partly recovered
from my astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said Pete laconically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p><p>Not long afterward there was a movement
among the wolves and, noiselessly as a panther
the figure of a man lithe and youthful in every
movement slipped to the side of the dead elk.
He made no noise, uttered no word to the
fierce black animals that sat with their red
tongues hanging from their panting jaws, but
without a moment&#8217;s hesitation whipped out a
knife and with a dexterity and skill that
brought the color to Big Pete&#8217;s face, proceeded
to take the coat off the wapiti, while the great
eagle perched upon the branching antlers.
The skin was removed and with equal dexterity
all the best parts of the meat were
skilfully detached and packed in the green
hide, after which, removing a large slice of
red flesh, the strange hunter held up one
finger. One of the wolves gravely walked up
to him, received the morsel, gulped it down
and retired. Each in turn was fed, then the
great bird flopped on his shoulder and was fed
from his hand, and before I could realize what
had happened the man, the wolves and the
eagle had disappeared, leaving nothing but
the dismembered carcass of the elk to remind
us of the strange episode.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>To say that the whole spectacle that I had
just witnessed startled me would be stating it
mildly indeed. The strange appearance of this
big, powerful, smooth shaven man in a buckskin
hunting costume with a retinue of black
wolves and a trained eagle, the mysterious
manner of his hunting and his coming and
going, aroused in me great interest and curiosity
and I could realize the effect it evidently
had upon Big Pete&#8217;s superstitious mind in
spite of the fact that the big fellow was
accustomed to facing almost any sort of
danger. As for me, I could not myself prevent
the creeping chills from running down my
spine whenever I thought of the wild man.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that this strange,
half-wild man of the mountains, this killer,
this master of a wolf pack, could be in any
way connected with my father? I wondered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and as I wondered I found that a vague fear
of this mad man who despite his reputed age
seemed as youthful and as agile as a man in
his thirties, was gripping me. Perhaps the
strangeness of the wilderness park added to
my awe, for certainly one could expect almost
anything supernatural to happen in the twilight
of the forest of giant trees, whose
interlacing branches overhead shut out the
light of heaven.</p>

<p>Recovering somewhat from my astonishment
and surprise, I realized that what I had
witnessed, strange though it appeared, was
not a supernatural occurrence. I knew that
it was a real gun I had heard, real smoke I
had seen, real man, real bird, real elk, and
real wolves.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Pete,&#8221; I exclaimed, as a sudden
thought struck me, &#8220;what&#8217;s become of our
dogs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better ask them black fiends up the mountains.
I reckon you won&#8217;t see them tha&#8217;
hounds of yours agin.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>And I never did, but having hunted the
wolf with cowboys and having been a witness
to their extraordinary biting power, I knew
the fate that must necessarily befall a couple
of ordinary hounds when overtaken by half
a dozen full-grown wolves. On such occasions
we do not spend much time in grief over a loss
of any kind, &#8220;it taint according to mountain
law,&#8221; Pete would say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon we had better swipe some of that
elk before the coyotes get at it,&#8221; growled
Pete. &#8220;The wild mountainman knows the
good parts, but an elk is an elk, and one wild
man, even if he is a giant, can&#8217;t carry off all
the good meat, not by a long shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may come back,&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not he,&#8221; said Pete. &#8220;He&#8217;s too stuck up
for that. When he wants more, them tha&#8217;
black demons and that voodoo bird of his&#8217;n
will get &#8217;em for him, and he&#8217;s a hanging his
long legs off&#8217;ner a rock some whar smoking a
long cigar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dod rot him,&#8221; growled Pete. &#8220;Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
couldn&#8217;t he leave a piece of hide to carry the
meat in and the stomach to cook it in?
That&#8217;s the fust time I ever stayed long
&#8217;nough to see him collar his meat, though
they say he do eat the game raw, but I
reckon that&#8217;s a lie, leastwise he didn&#8217;t do&#8217;t
this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a good square meal of the locoed
hunter&#8217;s elk under our belts and a rousing
camp fire before which to toast our shins,
both the big westerner and I felt a little more
natural and comfortable, but our conversation
turned again to this wild hunter of the mountains.</p>

<p>I could see that the mysterious old man with
his wolf pack and eagle aroused almost every
possible form of superstition in Big Pete and
I confess that I was not free from some of it
myself. The guide was certain that the man
was either a ghost or a reincarnated devil,
and he displayed no uncertain signs of awe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; said Pete, &#8220;he&#8217;s a devil.
He&#8217;s over a hundred years old, for my dad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
says he seed him, an&#8217; an Injun before dad&#8217;s
time told him about him. They are all
skeered t&#8217; death o&#8217; him. An&#8217; I don&#8217;t blame
&#8217;em. He&#8217;s a shore enough hant and them
tha&#8217; houn&#8217;s o&#8217; his&#8217;n is devils in wolf skins.
Jumping Gehoosaphats, ef they shed ever cut
my trail I reckon I&#8217;d just lay right down an&#8217;
die,&#8221; and Big Pete actually shuddered at the
possibility.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, young feller,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;that ol&#8217;
man shoots gold bullets out o&#8217; a real Patrick
Mullen gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Mullen gun, Pete?&#8221; I cried, &#8220;how do you
know, man; speak for goodness sake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s a Patrick Mullen and
guess it tain&#8217;t one &#8217;cause a Patrick Mullen
rifle would cost a thousand or more. But
the old Injun, Beaver Tail, says, someone
told his father and his father told him that et
is a Patrick Mullen gun an&#8217; is a special make
inlaid with gold and silver, an&#8217; all ornamented
up, an&#8217; built for an ol&#8217; muzzle-loadin&#8217; flint-lock.
Now Mullen never made no flint-lock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
rifles that I hear&#8217;n tell of, his specialty be
shotguns an&#8217; if he made this rifle I&#8217;m ganderplucked
if I cud tell how this spook got it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless the wild Hunter might be a relative
of old Patrick Mullen,&#8221; I said, thinking aloud,
and gasping at the thought, for the description
of the rifle somehow impressed me again with
the possibility that this wild man of the mountains
might himself be Donald Mullen, and
<i>my own father!</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say that, kid?&#8221; asked Big
Pete with a queer look in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know, I was just wondering
to myself. But what makes you think he&#8217;s a
supernatural being, and, Pete, does this wild
loony hunter look at all like me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Super what? Say when did you swallow
a dictionary?&mdash;Oh, you mean what makes
me think he&#8217;s a devil. No, he don&#8217;t favor you
none,&#8221; he added with a grin, &#8220;he&#8217;s a <i>handsome</i>
devil, although he&#8217;s done terrified every white
man, an&#8217; Injun, in these parts half t&#8217; death,
so most of &#8217;ems afeared to come back here at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
all. Men have gone in the park jest to get this
wild man&#8217;s scalp, but they&#8217;ve done come back
scared yaller an&#8217; they ain&#8217;t opened their trap
much about him since nuther. They do say he
spits fire an&#8217; chaws his meat offen the bone an&#8217;
then cracks the bones like a dog an&#8217; swallers
it all. They do say, too, that he roars like
forty devils with their tails cut off when he
gits mad an&#8217; some say as when he wants t&#8217;
git som wha&#8217; in a hurry he jest grabs aholt o&#8217;
the feet o&#8217; tha&#8217; there thunder bird and she
flies off with him and draps him anywha&#8217; he
asks her to&mdash;Nope, I hain&#8217;t seen none of these
things myself but others say they has, an&#8217;
believe me, I&#8217;m plumb cautious when travelin&#8217;
these parts alone. Howsomever, he hain&#8217;t
yet skeered me &#8217;nough to make my ha&#8217;r come
out by the roots,&#8221; said Pete with a yawn.
&#8220;There, kick that back log over so&#8217;s the fire can
lick at t&#8217;other side; now let&#8217;s turn in.&#8221;</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>Big Pete and I spent several weeks in our
charming little camp at the lower end of the
park, for my guide decided that despite the
recent presence of the wild hunter, here would
be a good place to get a shot at some black-tail
deer. In fact we saw signs of those
animals all about and my guide was only looking
for fresh indication to start out on our last
hunt before we made our way deeper into the
wilderness.</p>

<p>On the third day of our stay I was returning
to camp with my shotgun over my shoulder
and a brace of sage grouse in my hand, when
I came upon Big Pete in a swail about a mile
from camp. He was bending low and examining
fresh signs when he saw me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Howdy, kid, here&#8217;s some doin&#8217;s. Shall
we foller him?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>&#8220;Of course, Pete; what are we here for, the
mountain air?&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Pete, in his deep, low voice,
&#8220;we&#8217;re here for game,&#8221; and off he started, but
slowly and with great caution. I felt impatient,
but restrained myself, saying nothing
and continued to follow my big guide who now
moved with the most painstaking care. Not
a twig broke beneath his moccasins as with
panther-like step and crouching form he led
me through a lot of young trees over a rocky
place until we struck a small spring with a
soft muddy margin. Here Pete came to a
sudden halt. I asked him why he did not go
on, and he pointed to a ledge of rock that ran
up the mountain side diagonally with a flat,
natural roadbed on top, graded like a stage
road but unlike a traveled road, ending in a
bunch of underwood and brush about a hundred
yards ahead.</p>

<p>Above the ledge of the rocks was a steep
declivity of loose shale sprinkled over with
large and small boulders of radically different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
formations, and in no manner resembling the
friable, uncertain bed upon which they rested.</p>

<p>These boulders undoubtedly showed the result
of the grinding and polishing of an ancient,
slow-moving glacier, but some other force had
deposited them in the present position.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in tha&#8217;,&#8221; whispered Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, the wild mountain man?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered my guide, &#8220;th&#8217; grizzly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The what?&#8221; I almost shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; grizzly,&#8221; answered Pete; &#8220;what do
you think we&#8217;ve been following?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Black-tailed deer,&#8221; I said softly, with my
eyes glued on the thicket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, tenderfoot, here&#8217;s the trail of that
tha&#8217; <i>deer</i>, and he hain&#8217;t been gone by here
mor&#8217;n nor a week ago, nuther.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked and there in the soft mud was the
print of a foot, a human-looking foot, but
for the evenness in the length of the toes and
the sharpness and length of the toe nails.
Yes, there was another difference, and that
was the size. It was the footprint of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
savage Hercules, the track of an enormous
grizzly bear, and the soft mud that had dripped
from the big foot was still undried on the
leaves and grass when Pete pointed it out to
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Pete, don&#8217;t forget your promise that
I am to have first shot at all big game,&#8221; I
whispered with my best effort at coolness, but
my heart was thumping against my ribs at
a terrific rate.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;why, bless you old man!&#8221; I whispered
excitedly as I looked at my gun, &#8220;I am
armed only with a shotgun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tha&#8217;s all right,&#8221; replied the big trapper
complacently; then, with a quick motion, he
whipped out his keen-edged knife and snatching
one of my cartridges he severed the shell
neatly between the two wads which separated
the powder and shot; that is, a wad in each
piece of the cartridge was exposed by the cut.</p>

<p>Guided by the faint longitudinal seam where
the edges of the colored paper join on the shell,
Big Pete carefully fitted the two parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
cartridge together exactly as they were before
being cut apart. Breaking my gun, he slipped
the mutilated ammunition into the unchoked
barrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tha&#8217;,&#8221; he grunted, &#8220;tha&#8217;s better than a
bullet at short range, an&#8217;ll tar a hole in old
Ephraim big enough to put your arm through.&#8221;</p>

<p>He cut two more in the same manner, saying,
&#8220;Be darned kerful not to get excited and
put them in your choke barl, or tha&#8217; may be
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hunting a grizzly with a shotgun and bird
shot was not my idea of safe sport, but I was
too much of a moral coward to acknowledge
to Pete that I was frightened. Pete examined
his gun, ran his finger over the cartridges in
his belt, and went through all the familiar
motions which to him were unconscious but
always foretold danger ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;You drap on your prayer hinges behind
that tha&#8217; nigger head,&#8221; said Pete, &#8220;and you
will have a dead shot at the brute, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll go
up and roll a stone down the mountain side and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
follow it as fast as I kin, so as to be ready to
help you if you need it; but you ought to drap
him at first shot at short range. Yer must
drap him, yer must or I allow tha&#8217;ll be a right
smart of a scrap here, and don&#8217;t yer forget
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no Christmas turkey shooting,
young feller, so look sharp,&#8221; and with a noiseless
tread Pete vanished in the wood, while I
with beating heart and bulging eyes watched
the thicket at the end of the ledge. I had not
long to wait before I heard a blood-curdling
yell and then crash! crash! crash! came a big
boulder tearing down the mountain side. It
reached a point just over the thicket, struck a
small pine tree, broke the tree and leaped
high into the air, then crashed into the middle
of the brush.</p>

<p>Following with giant leaps came Big Pete
Darlinkel down the rocky declivity, but I
only looked that way for one instant, then my
eyes were again fixed on the thicket, and in
my excitement I arose to a standing position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
There was but a momentary silence after the
fall of the boulder before I heard the rustling
of sticks and leaves, saw the top of the bushes
sway as some heavy body moved beneath,
then there appeared a head, and what a head
it was! Bigger than all outdoors! I aimed
my gun, but my body swayed and the end
of my shotgun described a large circle in the
air. I knew that my position was serious, but
my nerves played me false.</p>

<p>I had never before faced a grizzly. I heard
Big Pete&#8217;s voice calling to me to drop behind
the rock, but I only stood there with a dogged
stupidity, trying to aim my gun at a mark
which seemed to me as big almost as a barn-door.</p>

<p>I heard Pete give a sudden cry then there
was a rattle of stones and dirt on the ledge
in front of the mountain of brownish hair that
was advancing in sort of side leaps or bounds
like a big ball.</p>

<p>The bear came to a sudden stop, and to my
horror I saw the form of my friend shoot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
over the edge of the overhanging rock right
in the path of the grizzly. It all flashed
through my mind in a moment. Pete in his
haste to reach me had lost control of himself
and slid with the rolling stones and dirt over
the mountain side, a fall of at least twenty-five
feet!</p>

<p>Instantly my nerve returned and I rushed
madly up the incline to rescue my companion.
I bounded between the branches of some stout
saplings, they parted as my body struck them
but sprung together again before my leg had
cleared the V-shaped opening.</p>

<p>My foot was imprisoned and I fell with a
heavy thud on my face. For an instant I
was dazed, but even in my dazed state I was
fully conscious of Pete&#8217;s impending peril,
and I kicked and struggled blindly to free
myself. My gun had been flung from my hand
in my fall and was out of my reach. Then to
my horror I heard the howl the wolf gives when
game is in sight, and even half blind as I was
I saw dark, dog-like forms sweep by me; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
heard the scream of an eagle; I heard a snarling
and yelping, the sounds of a struggle&mdash;I
ceased to kick, wiped the blood from my eyes
and looked ahead.</p>

<p>There lay Big Pete Darlinkel, dead or
unconscious, and within ten feet of him
stood the giant bear surrounded by a vicious
pack of gaunt red-mouthed wolves. The
bear made a rush and a shadow passed over
the ground; I heard the sound of a large body
rushing swiftly through the air, and an
immense eagle struck the bear like a thunderbolt;
at the same instant the wolves attacked
him from all sides; then there was a whistle
keen and clear; the wolves retreated; the bird
again soared aloft; the bear made several
passes in the air in search of the bird, fell
forward again on all fours, rose on its hind
legs and killed a wolf with one sweep of its
great paw.</p>

<p>The bear now made a dash at the giant
leader of the pack, only to fall forward, dead,
with its ugly nose across Big Pete&#8217;s chest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>Then I remembered hearing the crack of a
rifle, and knew that the Wild Mountain Man
had saved our lives. I tried to rise but found
my ankle so badly sprained that I could not
stand on it.</p>

<p>Suddenly a low voice with a hint of an
Irish accent said, &#8220;Sit down, stranger, while
I look to your mate,&#8221; and I saw the tall lithe
figure of a man clothed in buckskin bending
over Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only stunned, friend,&#8221; said he, and I
heard no more. The blow on my head,
combined with the pain from my ankle was
too much for me, and now that the danger was
over it was a good time to faint, and I took
advantage of it.</p>

<p>How long I remained unconscious I do not
know, but when my eyes opened again it was
night; through the interlacing boughs overhead
the stars were shining brightly, my head
was neatly bandaged and so was my foot and
ankle. I could hear our horses cropping grass
near by. I raised my head and there lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Pete; he was alive I knew by his snores that
issued from his nose, and we were in our own
camp; but&mdash;what are those animals by our
camp fire? Wolves! gaunt, shaggy wolves!</p>

<p>I hastily arose to a sitting posture, but my
alarm subsided when in the dim light of the
fire I could trace the outline of another man&#8217;s
figure, and on a stick close to the stranger&#8217;s
head roosted a giant bird.</p>

<p>Could it be that this wild man of the mountain&mdash;possibly
my own father&mdash;was camping
with us?</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>&#8220;Moseyed, by gum! I&#8217;ll be tarnally tarnashuned
if that terri-fa-ca-cious spook hain&#8217;t
pulled out!&#8221; was the exclamation that awakened
me the morning after our adventure with
the bear.</p>

<p>Lazily opening my eyes I gazed a moment
at the sun just peeping over the mountain,
then closed them again; but when I attempted
to change my position a sharp pain in my
ankle thoroughly awakened me. Still I lay
quiet because it was some time before I could
collect my scattered senses and separate in
my mind the real incident and the dream
phantasms.</p>

<p>The pain in my ankle, the swelled and
irritated condition of my nose plainly proved
to me that there was no dream about my injuries,
but I discovered that my head and leg
were neatly bandaged with strips of fine linen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
I sat for a while busily collecting the incidents
of the past twenty-four hours, arranging them
in my mind in their proper order and place.
I cut out the dream portion from the realities
with very little trouble until I reached the
part where I had awakened in the night and
had seen the wolves, the eagle and the Wild
Hunter. I could not be sure whether that was
a dream or reality. Had I seen this strange
old man with his eagle and his wolf pack
beside our camp fire or had I dreamed it?
Had this hobgoblin man, who might be my
own father, rescued me from death at the
claws of the grizzly and bound my wounds
for me, or was that but a dream too? Had
not Big Pete saved me perhaps and cared for
me afterward?</p>

<p>&#8220;Pete, old fellow,&#8221; I said presently, rising
to my elbow, &#8220;who brought me to camp?
Who killed that bear? Who saved our lives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Wild Hunter,&#8221; replied Pete gravely.
&#8220;He bathed my head with some sort of good
smelling stuff and, though I am as heavy as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
dead buffaler, toted me to camp; he &#8217;lowed
that I was all sort of shuk up and a little
hazy; he fixed my blanket, then he fotched
you in on his shoulders just as if you was a
dead antelope, fixed you up with bandages
torn from handkerchiefs in your pocket, gave
you a drink which you didn&#8217;t seem to appreciate,
but just swallowed like you were asleep,
then he laid you out. I had my eye peeled
on him but he said nary a word, an&#8217; when
we wuz both all comfortable he pulled out a
long cigar, sot down by the fire and was
smoking tha&#8217; with his bird and his wolves
around him when I went to sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;He cut his bullets out, as he allus does,&#8221;
muttered Pete a little while later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who cut what bullets?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whomsoever cud I mean but th&#8217; Wild
Hunter, and wha&#8217;s tha&#8217; been any bullets
lately but in th&#8217; b&#8217;ar?&#8221; queried my companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; I admitted, &#8220;but why do
you suppose he cut out the bullets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I reckon tha&#8217; might be right scarce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and he haster be kinder sparing with them.
I calculate you&#8217;d like to have a hatful of them
balls, leastwise most folks would; cause
the Wild Hunter don&#8217;t use no common low-flung
lead for his bullets, no-sir-ree bob-horsefly!
Tain&#8217;t good &#8217;nuff for a high-cock-alorum
like him&mdash;<i>he shoots balls of virgin gold!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>But I was more interested in what had
become of this strange man than in the sort
of projectiles rumor said that he used in his
gun and so dismissed the subject with a
request for further information about our
rescuer.</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning when I opened my peepers,&#8221;
Pete continued, &#8220;I t&#8217;ought maybe the Wild
Hunter had only gone off on a tramp; but
he&#8217;s done clared out for good, and tuk his
wolves and bird with him. I&#8217;m some glad he
took th&#8217; wolves, I don&#8217;t sorter like the look
of their mean eyes; they do say that he is a
wolf himself and the head of the pack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, Pete? Steady, old man, now
let&#8217;s go slow.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>&#8220;All right; tha&#8217;s wha&#8217; I mean ter do.
&#8217;Cause it hain&#8217;t a varmint natur&#8217; to help
men folks, and he done helped us, and no
mistake, and left us the bulk of the b&#8217;ar too,&mdash;only
took the claws, teeth and tenderloin or
two for himself and pack; that is, if he be a
wolf. But we will settle that if your foot
will let you walk a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only over yan way to the first piece of
wet ground, and the trail leads down to tha&#8217;
spring tha&#8217;, and tha&#8217; is quite a right smart
bit of muddy swail beyont.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll try it,&#8221; I exclaimed. But
I could not touch my foot on the ground, and
it was not until my guide had made me a
crutch of a forked branch, padded with
a piece of fur, that I was able to go limping
along after Big Pete.</p>

<p>We followed the trail left by the Wild
Hunter to the spring. The trail after that
was plain, even to my inexperienced eyes;
and when we reached the muddy spot the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
print of the moccasined feet and the dog-like
tracks of the wolves were distinctly visible.</p>

<p>But look at Big Pete!</p>

<p>As motionless as a statue, with a solemn
face he stoops with a rigid figure pointing to
the trail! I hastened to his side and saw that
the moccasin prints ceased in the middle of
an open, bare, muddy place and beyond were
nothing but the dog-like tracks of the wolves.</p>

<p>I looked up and all around; there were no
overhanging branches that a man could
swing himself upon, no stones that he could
leap upon&mdash;nothing but the straggling bunches
of ferns; but here in this open spot the Wild
Hunter vanished.</p>

<p>We walked back in silence, for I had nothing
to say, and Pete did not volunteer any further
information.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>To have one&#8217;s nose all but broken, both
eyes blackened and a twisted ankle is a sad
misfortune wherever it occurs, but when such
a thing happens to a fellow many weary miles
from the nearest human habitation and in a
howling wilderness it might be considered
anything but pleasant. Yet, strange as it
may appear, among the most pleasant and
precious memories I have stored away in my
mind, only to be tapped upon special occasions,
is the memory of the glorious days spent nursing
my bruises and lolling around that far-away
camp. Sometimes I listened to the
quaint yarns of my unique and interesting
guide or idly watched the changing colors and
effects which the sun and the atmosphere produced
on the snow-capped mountains of
Darlinkel&#8217;s Park. I made friends with our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
little neighbors the rock-chuck, whose home
was in the base of the cliff back of the spring,
and became intimate with the golden chipmunk
and its pretty little black and white
cousin, the four-striped chipmunk, both of
which were common and remarkably tame
about camp.</p>

<p>Back of the camp in the dark shade of the
evergreens there was a bark mound composed
entirely of the fragments of the conifera cones,
which Pete said was the squirrel&#8217;s dining room.
This mound contained at least four good cart-loads
of fragments and all of it was the work
of the impudent little blunt-nosed red squirrels,
which were plentiful in the woods.</p>

<p>How long it took these small rodents to
heap such a mass of material together I was
unable to calculate, but the mound was as
large as some of the shell heaps made by the
ancient oyster-eating men and left by them
along our coast from Florida to Maine.</p>

<p>The numerous magpies seemed to be conscious
of my admiration of their beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
piebald plumage and to take every opportunity
to show off its iridescent hues to the best
advantage in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Pete evidently thought I was a chap of
very low taste, with a great lack of discrimination
in the choice of my friends among the
forest folk, and he could see no reason for
my intimacy with &#8220;all th&#8217; outlaws and most
rascally varmints of the park.&#8221;</p>

<p>Truth compels me to admit that the pranks
of some of my little friends were often mischievous
and annoying, but they were also
humorous and entertaining and I laughed
when the &#8220;tallow-head&#8221; jay swooped down
and snatched a tid-bit from Pete&#8217;s plate just as
he was about to eat it, and when the irate
trapper threw his plate at the camp robber
it was a charming sight to see a number of
birds flutter down to feast upon the scattered
food.</p>

<p>The loud-mouthed, self-asserting fly-catcher
in the cottonwood tree learned to know my
whistle, and whenever I attempted to mimic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
him he would send back a ringing answer.
The charming little lazulii buntings were
tamer than the irritating dirty English sparrows
at home.</p>

<p>It was interesting to notice how quickly all
our little wild neighbors learned to know that
the sound produced by banging on a tin plate
meant dough-god and other good things at our
camp, and as they came rustling among the
grasses or fluttering from bush and trees they
showed more fear of each other than they did
of Pete and me.</p>

<p>When the myriads of bright stars would
twinkle in the blue black sky or the great
round-faced moon climb over the mountain
tops to see what was doing in the park, the
birds and chipmunks were quiet, but then
the big pack-rats, with squirrel-like tails,
would troop out from their secret caves and
invade the camp.</p>

<p>In the gray dawn, while sleeping in a tent,
I often awakened to hear something scamper
up its steep side and then laughed to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
shadow of a comical little body toboggan
down the canvas. Our pocket-knives, compasses
and all other small objects were never
safe unless securely packed away out of reach
of these nocturnal marauders.</p>

<p>Our conversations around the camp fire
evenings were highly interesting too, for Big
Pete was a fluent talker with a wealth of
stories of the Great West at his tongue&#8217;s end.
Indeed, the story of his family and their
migration west was one that fascinated me.
His father had been a trapper in the old days;
he had done his share of roaming the mountains,
prospecting and making his strikes,
small and large, fighting Indians and living
the strenuous life of the border pioneer. He
had found the woman he afterward married
unconscious under an overturned wagon of
an emigrant train that had been raided by the
Indians, and after nursing her back to health
in his mining shack, had married her. With
money he had worked from the &#8220;diggin&#8217;s&#8221;
he had acquired, by grants from the government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the beautiful and expansive mountain
park where he had planned to develop a
ranch. He never went very far with his
project, however, for a raiding party of
Indians caught him alone in the mountains
and his wife found his body pinned to the
ground with arrows. The shock of his tragedy
killed Big Pete&#8217;s mother soon after, and the
young Peter Darlinkel, then three years old,
went to a nearby settlement to be brought up
by an uncle and a squaw aunt. Pete became
prospector, scout, trapper and hunter, using
this beautiful park that became his as a result
of the passing of his father, as a private game
preserve, so to speak. That is, it was private
except for the intrusion of the Wild Hunter
and his black wolf pack.</p>

<p>In a fragmentary way Big Pete told me this
story and other interesting tales of this wild
western country, but mostly our conversation
turned to this old man of the mountains who
was such a mystery to everyone, even to Big
Pete, but who, despite the lugubrious reputation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
had proved a kindly gentleman and a
good friend to me.</p>

<p>There were no visible signs of a change in the
weather which had been clear for weeks, and
the sky was otherwise clear blue save where
the white mares&#8217; tails swept across the heavens.
But when we sat down to supper that evening
I could hear the rumbling of distant thunder.
I knew it was thunder for, although the fall
of avalanches makes the same noise, avalanches
choose the noon time to fall when the
sun is hottest and the snows softest. Soon I
could see the heads of some dark clouds
peering at us over the mountains and before
dark the clouds crept over the mountain tops
and overcast our sky.</p>

<p>It rained all that night in a fitful manner and
came to a stop about four <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> The wind
went down and the air seemed to have lost its
vivacity and life; it was a dead atmosphere;
we arose from our blankets feeling tired and
listless.</p>

<p>While we were eating our breakfast dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
clouds again suddenly obscured the heavens
and before we had finished the meal big drops
of rain set the camp fire spluttering and drove
us to the shelter of our tent; then it rained!
Lord help us! the water came down in such
torrents that on account of the spray we could
not see thirty feet; then came hailstones as
large as hen&#8217;s eggs. There was some lightning
and thunder, but either the splashing of the
water drowned the rumbling or the electric
fluid was so far distant that the reports were
not loud when they reached us. Suddenly
there was a ripping noise, followed by a sort
of subdued roar which stampeded our horses
from their shelter under a projecting rock and
made the earth shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Earthquake!&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wuss,&#8221; said Pete, &#8220;hit&#8217;s a landslide.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly a thought went through my brain
like a hot bullet and made me shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pete,&#8221; I shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m right hyer, tenderfut, you needn&#8217;t holler
so loud,&#8221; he answered, and calmly filled his pipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>I flung myself impulsively on my companion,
grasped his big brawny shoulders, and
with my face close to his I whispered, &#8220;Pete,
I believe the slide occurred at the gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, hit did sound that-a-way,&#8221; admitted
Pete composedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pete,&#8221; I continued, &#8220;that butte has caved
in on our trail!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull, tenderfut, we ain&#8217;t hurt, be we?
Tha&#8217;s plenty of game here fur the tak&#8217;n of it
and plenty of water, as fine as ever spouted
from old Moses&#8217; rock, right at hand. If the
Mesa&#8217;s cut our trail we can live well here for
a hundred years and not have to chew wolf
mutton neither. I don&#8217;t reckon I can go to
York with you just yet,&#8221; drawled my comrade
in a most provokingly imperturbable manner,
as he slowly freed himself from my grasp and
made for the camp fire, which being to a great
extent sheltered by an overhanging rock, was
still smouldering in spite of the drenching rain.
Raking the ashes until he found a red glowing
coal, Pete deftly picked it up and by juggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
it from one hand to the other, he conducted
the live ember to his pipe-bowl, then he puffed
away as calmly as if there was nothing in this
world to trouble him.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the gate be shut,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;it will
keep out prospectors, tramps and Injuns.&#8221;
With that he went to smoking his red-willow<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
bark again.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The trappers and Indians made Kil-i-ki-nic, or Kinnikinick, by
mixing tobacco with the inside bark of red willow, which is the
common name for the red osier of the dogwood family. <span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p></div>

<p>But I could not view the situation so complacently,
and when the rain had ceased as
suddenly as it began, with some difficulty I
caught my horse and made my way to the
gate, to discover that my worst fears were
realized; a large section of the cliff had split
off the Mesa and slid down into the narrow
gateway completely filling the space and
leaving a wall of over one hundred feet of
sheer precipice for us to climb before we could
escape from our Eden-like prison.</p>

<p>Again a wave of superstitious dread swept
over me as I viewed the tightly closed exit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>a dread that perhaps after all there was more
to Big Pete&#8217;s superstitions about the Wild
Hunter than I dared to admit, else why should
that cliff which had stood for thousands of
years take this opportunity to split off and
choke up the ancient trail?</p>

<p>The longer I questioned myself, the less
was my ability to answer. I sat on a stone
and for some time was lost in thought. When
at length I looked up it was to see Big Pete
with folded arms silently gazing at the barricaded
exit and the muddy pool of water extending
for some distance back of the gateway
into the park.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, tenderfut, you was dead right in
your judication. The gate air shut sure
&#8217;nuff. Our horses ain&#8217;t likely to take the
back trail and leave us, that&#8217;s sartin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Pete,&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;how will we ever
get out? Must we spend the remainder of
our lives here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It do look as if we&#8217;d stop hyer a right
smart bit,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;maybe till this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
hyer holler between the mountains all fills
with water agin like it was onct before, I
reckon. Don&#8217;t you think that we&#8217;d better get
busy and build a Noah&#8217;s Ark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pete, you&#8217;d joke if the world came to an
end. But seriously I think we might move
our camp back to the far end of your park.&#8221;</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>One day after we had selected our new camp,
I took my rod along and wandered into the
wonderful forest of ancient trees. There I
seated myself on a log to think over my experience.
Somehow my own trials and ambitions
seemed small, trivial and not worth
while when I looked upon those grand trees
standing silently on guard as they were standing
when Columbus was busy smashing a hard-boiled
egg to make it stand on end. Yes,
naturalists tell us some of these same trees
were standing before the New Testament was
written and then as now their branches concealed
their lofty tops and formed a screen
through which the powerful rays of the noon-day
sun are filtered, refined and subdued to a
dreamy twilight below, a twilight in which
the soft green mosses and lace-like ferns thrive
into luxuriant growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>It was so still and quiet in that forest that
the silence seemed to hurt my ears and I
found myself listening to see if I could not hear
the deep dark blue blossoms of the fringed
gentians whispering scandals about the flaming
Indian paint brushes that flourished in
the opening in the woods where the sun&#8217;s
ray could reach and warm the dark earth.
As I listened I could not help but speculate
a great deal as to the possibilities of the odd
old man of this forest being in some way
connected with my father&#8217;s history, but the
story of the wolf-man as given to me by my
big companion was so varied and so mixed
with the superstitions of the Indians and
trappers who had come in contact with him,
or had seen him and his weird wolf pack
roaming the mountains, that I could not
in any way take it as the basis for a solution
of the problem.</p>

<p>Indeed, the more Big Pete told me the less
I believed that this strange and probably
mad man could be my father. In truth, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
only real clue or even faint reason I had for
believing that he owned the missing &#8220;Patrick
Mullen&#8221; was because this gun at a distance
seemed to correspond with the description of
the Mullen&#8217;s gun. It was a faint clue indeed
and sometimes seemed not worth investigation.
Yet when I began to doubt the possibility
an unexplained impulse or force kept
urging me on to believe that if I but persisted
and found an opportunity to examine this gun
it would prove to be the one I sought, and if I
had a chance to talk to this strange Wild
Hunter much of the mystery that surrounded
my own babyhood would be cleared up, so
I found myself earnestly longing for a real
interview with this mysterious creature.</p>

<p>The more I thought of it the more I was
inclined to believe that I was on the right
track, until at last convinced that this was so,
I cried aloud, &#8220;I have found him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who! Who!&#8221; queried a startled owl, as it
peered down at me from its hiding place in
the dense foliage of a cedar far above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>&#8220;Never mind who, you old rascal,&#8221; I laughingly
replied, and picking up my fishing-rod I
parted the underbrush to start on my way
through the wood for some trout, but suddenly
halted when I found myself staring into the
face of a huge timber wolf. The beast&#8217;s lips
were drawn back displaying its gleaming fangs,
its back hair was as erect as the cropped mane
of a pony, its mongolian eyes shone green
through their narrow slits and its whole attitude
seemed to say, &#8220;Well, now that you have
found me, what do you propose to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, boys, do not make any mistake about
me, I am not a hero and never posed as one;
in truth my timidity at times amounts to
cowardice, a fact which I usually keep to
myself, but I never was afraid of wolves
until I so unexpectedly met this one. It is
needless to say that I have no hair on my back,
it is as bare as that of any other fellow&#8217;s,
nevertheless, on this occasion I could distinctly
feel my bristles rise from the nape of my neck
to the end of my spine, just the same as those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
on the oblique-eyed, shaggy monster whose
snapping teeth were so near my face.</p>

<p>Everybody is familiar with the fact that
people who have had limbs amputated often
complain of pains or itching in the missing
members. My missing back hair, the hair
which my ancestors lost by the slow process
of evolution, the hair which grew on the back
of the &#8220;missing link,&#8221; stood on end at the
sight of this wolf. However, this fear was
but momentary and when my courage returned
I lifted my rod case in a threatening
manner, and the wolf slunk away as noiselessly
as a shadow, and like a shadow faded
out of sight in the dim twilight of the ancient
forest. When I reached the open land beyond
the forest another surprise awaited me.</p>

<p>Surely this is heaven, I thought as I waded
knee-deep among the beautiful flowers of the
prairie, starting the sharp pin-tailed grouse,
prairie chickens and sage grouse from their
retreats and sending the meadow-larks skimming
away over flowering billows. Reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
an elevation where I could peer beyond the
crests of one of the &#8220;ground swells&#8221; which
furrowed the sea of nodding blossoms, I saw
through the stems of the plants, a part of the
prairie at first concealed from view, and there
appeared to be numerous irregular boulders
of dark brown stone scattered around among
the vegetation, and the boulders were moving!</p>

<p>Careful scrutiny, however, proved them to
be not stones but live buffalo. Big Pete
had often told me that these animals lived
unmolested by him in the park; but when I
realized that I was looking at between three
and four hundred real buffalo my heart gave
a great jump of joy. I tried to view them so
as to take in their details, but the apparently
shapeless masses of dark reddish brown wool
appeared to have none, unless indeed the
comical fur trousers with frayed bottoms on
their front legs might be called detail.</p>

<p>Even the faces of the beasts were so concealed
by masks of knotted wool that at first
I could distinguish neither eyes, noses, horns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
or ears; but in spite of their ragged trousers
and their masked faces, the bison are sublime
in their mighty strength and ponderous proportions,
and as this was the first wild herd
I had ever seen and one of the very few, if
not the only one, then extant, I viewed them
with the keenest interest.</p>

<p>But the scattered bunches of antelope, which
I now noticed were dotting the plains around
the buffalo, appealed to my love of the beautiful.
Knowing that in other localities these
charming little creatures are rapidly being
slaughtered and steadily decreasing in numbers
and that all attempts to breed them in
captivity have so far failed, they at once
absorbed my attention to the exclusion of
their larger neighbors.</p>

<p>When we moved our camp to the far side
of the lake, Big Pete told me that I could find
plenty of trout streams beyond the timber
belt, and he also informed me that I could
there see the walls of the park and satisfy
myself that there was but one trail leading
into the preserve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>I do not now recall the sort of walls that
were pictured in my mind or know what I
really expected to see enclosing Darlinkel&#8217;s
Park, but I do know that when I suddenly
emerged from the dark forests into the sunlit
prairie, the scene which greeted my vision
was not the one painted by my imagination.</p>

<p>Before me stretched an open plain surrounded
by mountains arising abruptly from
a bed of many colored flowers; they were the
same ranges whose snow-covered peaks formed
a feature of the landscape at the lake and at
our first camp.</p>

<p>Here, however, their appearance was different,
as different as the dark forest from
the open sunlit prairie. The scene at first
did not seem real, it had a sort of a drop-curtain
effect that was as familiar to me as
the row of footlights and gilded boxes, but
never did I expect to see those delicate tints,
that blue atmosphere, the fresco colored rocks
and all the theatrical properties of a drop-curtain
duplicated in nature, yet here it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
before me, not a detail wanting, even the
impossible mammoth bed of gaudy flowers at
the foot of the mountain was here and the
numerous cascades had not been forgotten.
Well, it does seem wonderful to me that
unknown theatrical daubers should know so
much more of nature than the public for
whom they paint.</p>

<p>But, nature is a bolder artist than even the
daring scenic painters; in front of me was a
prairie of flowers, acres and acres of waving,
undulating masses of color; thousands of
Arizona wyetha (wild sunflowers) mingled
with the brilliant tips of the fire-weed and
clumps of odorous and delicately colored
horsemint. There were other flowers unfamiliar
to me and hundreds of big blossoms of
what I took to be a member of the primrose
family. It was in this garden that the
buffalo and antelope were grazing.</p>

<p>An old buck antelope saw me and I instantly
dropped to the ground and was concealed by
the flowering vegetation. I wanted to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the home life of these animals, but was
disappointed because of the attention I had
attracted. When first discovered the does
were browsing with heads down and the kids
were playing tag with one another, every once
in a while spreading the white hair on their
rumps and then lowering the &#8220;white flag&#8221;
again, they apparently used it as a Morse
signal system of their own. But now they
were all alert and facing me; the bucks had
seen something and that something had
suddenly disappeared. This must be investigated,
so they circled round hesitatingly; the
apparition might be a foe but still they <i>must</i>
satisfy their curiosity and discover what it was
of which they had had a moment&#8217;s glimpse
and thus they approached nearer and ever
nearer to my place of concealment.</p>

<p>Soon, however, I became aware of the fact
that the antelope had unaccountably lost all
thought of me and were deeply interested in
something else which from their actions I
concluded to be recognized as an enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
It was now apparent that if Big Pete did not
hunt the prong-horns someone or something
else <i>did</i> hunt them.</p>

<p>As a bunch broke away from the scattered
groups and came in my direction, making great
leaps over the prairie, I detected the cause of
their panic in the form of a huge eagle which
was keeping pace with and flying over the
fleeing prong-horns.</p>

<p>The bird was not more than a dozen feet
above the animals&#8217; backs and in vain did
the poor creatures try to distance their
pursuer. At length they scattered, each one
taking a course of his own. Then the bird did
a strange thing. It singled out the largest
buck and persistently following him, it came
directly towards me and passed within ten
feet of my ambush, the broad wings of the
antelope&#8217;s relentless foe casting a dark shadow
over the straining muscles of the beautiful
animal&#8217;s back. I was tempted to drive the
bird away or shoot at it with my revolver,
but the thought that I had seen that bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
before restrained me and the fact that it pursued
a strong, healthy buck instead of selecting
a weaker and more easy prey convinced me
that this eagle had been trained to the hunt
and was not a wild<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> bird, for the immutable
law that &#8220;labor follows the line of least resistance&#8221;
holds good with all wild creatures.
It was not long before I had to use my field
glasses to follow the chase and then I discovered
that the poor prong-horn was showing
signs of fatigue. It had made a grave error
in dashing up an incline and the eagle from
his position above knew that the time had
come to strike and, like a thunderbolt, it
fell, striking its hooked talons in the graceful
neck of the terror-stricken antelope.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The late Howard Eaton of Wolf, Wyoming, watched an eagle
hunt down a prong-horned buck.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p></div>

<p>Hoping to get a nearer view of the last
tragedy, I hastened towards the spot and
before I was aware of my position, found
myself close to the herd of buffalo. I then
saw that these beasts being unaccustomed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>man, did not fear him, but on the contrary
meant to show fight. As I came to a sudden
halt the old bulls began to paw the earth,
throwing the dirt up over their backs and
bellowing with a low vibrating roar that was
terror-inspiring. Then they dropped to their
knees, rolled on their backs, got up, shook
themselves, licked their noses, &#8220;rolled up their
tails&#8221; into stiff curves, put down their heads
and came at me. The cows with their hair
standing on end like angry elks and bellowing
loudly were not behind their lords in aggressiveness
and the comical little calves came
bouncing along after their dame.</p>

<p>Was I frightened? That depends upon
one&#8217;s definition of the word. I was not
panic-stricken, but to say that I was not
<i>excited</i> when I saw those animated masses
of dark brown wool come roaring and thundering
at me would be to make boast that no
one who has had a similar experience would
believe.</p>

<p>Fortunately, not far behind me was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
hollow or gully already mentioned and I
bolted over the edge of it. As soon as the bank
concealed my person I ran as I never ran
before taking a course at right angles to my
original one and leeward of the herd, and at
last, out of breath, I rolled over in the weeds
and lay there panting and straining my ears
to hear the snorting beasts.</p>

<p>My chest felt dry, hot and oppressed from
forced and labored breathing, and had the
buffalo discovered me I do not think I could
have run another step. But the big brutes
halted at the edge of the bank and seeing no
one in sight walked around pawing and throwing
up great clouds of dust and in their rage
apparently daring me to come forth. Like
a small boy when he hears a challenge from
a gang of toughs, I decided that I did not want
to fight and lay as quiet as possible among
the sunflowers until I had regained my breath.
When the buffalo wandered back to their
original pasture land I, like a coyote, slunk
away and consoled myself with the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
that although I had had my run for my money,
at least, I had seen the death of the antelope
even if I did miss again seeing the Wild
Hunter &#8220;collar his game,&#8221; as Big Pete would
have called the act of securing it. Besides
this I had a real exciting adventure with
good red-blooded American animals and
learned the lesson that large horned beasts
which have not been taught to fear man are
exceedingly dangerous to man.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>Rising abruptly from the prairie was a
frowning precipice a thousand or more feet
high and above and beyond the top of this
cliff, the mountains.</p>

<p>When Big Pete told me that his park was
&#8220;walled in&#8221; he told me the mildest sort of
truth; the prairie is the bottom of a wide
canyon, in fact everything seems to indicate
that the whole park had settled, sunk&mdash;&#8220;taken
a drop&#8221; of a thousand or more feet;
forming what miners would call a fault.</p>

<p>From the glaciers up among the clouds
numerous streams of melted ice came dashing
down the sides of the mountain range, fanciful
cascades leaping without fear from most
stupendous heights spreading out in long
horse-tail falls over the face of the cliff, doing
everything but looking real. At the foot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
each of the falls there was a pool of deep
water, in one or two instances the pools were
smooth basins hollowed out of solid rock
in which the water was as transparent as air
and but for the millions of air bubbles caused
by the falling water every inch of bottom
could be plainly seen by an observer at the
brink of the pool.</p>

<p>The trout in these basins were almost as
colorless as the water itself (the light color
of the fish is due to their chameleon-like
power of modifying their hue to imitate their
surroundings)&mdash;this mimicry is so perfect
that after looking into one of these stone
basins, the rounded smooth sides of which
offered no shade or nook where a trout might
hide, I was ready to declare the waters uninhabited
but no sooner had my brown hackel
or professor settled lightly on the surface of
the pool than out from among the air bubbles
a fish appeared and seized the fly.</p>

<p>My sprained ankle was now so much improved
that upon discovering a diagonal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
fracture in the face of the cliff, which looked
as if offering a foot hold, and feeling reckless,
I determined to make the effort to scale the
wall at this point.</p>

<p>If the giant &#8220;fault&#8221; is of comparatively
recent occurrence, geologically speaking, it
seemed reasonable that there would be trout
in the streams above the cliff and the memory
of the fact that Pete had reported that both
Rocky Mountain sheep and goats were up
there decided me to attempt to scale the wall
by the fracture. It was a long, hard climb
and more than once while I clung to the
chance projections or dug my fingers into
small cracks and looked down upon the backs
of some golden eagle sailing in spirals below
me, I regretted making the fool-hardy attempt,
but when the top was reached and I saw
signs of sheep and had a peep at a white
object I took to be a goat, I felt repaid for my
arduous climb.</p>

<p>The elevated prairie or table-land on which
I found myself corresponded in every important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
particular with the park below; there
were the same natural divisions of prairie
and forests, the same erratic boulders, but
on account of the difference in elevation there
was a corresponding difference in plant life,
and most interesting of all to me, there were
the trout streams. The tablelands above
the park were comparatively level in places
where the stream ran almost as quietly as a
meadow brook, but these level stretches were
interrupted at short distance by foaming
rapids, jagged rocks and roaring falls.</p>

<p>My angler&#8217;s instinct told me that the
biggest fish lurked in the deep pools, to reach
which it was necessary to creep and worm
myself over the open flats of sharp stones
and patches of heather, but once on the vantage
ground the swish of a trout rod sounded
there for the first time since the dawn of
Creation.</p>

<!-- <p>[Blank Page]</p> -->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p><p>There was an audible splash at my first cast.
My, how that reel did sing! Before I realized
it, my fish had reached rapid water and taken
out a dangerous amount of line; still I dared
not check him too severely among the sharp
rocks and swift waters, so I ran along the
bank, stumbling over stones, but managing
to avail myself of every opportunity to wind
in the line until I had the satisfaction of
seeing enough line on my reel to prepare me
for possible sudden dashes and emergencies.</p>

<p>Ah! that was a glorious fight, and when at
last I was able to steer my tired fish into
shallow water I saw there were three of them,
one lusty trout on each of my three flies.
I had no landing net so I gently slid the almost
exhausted fish onto a gravel bar and as I did
so I experienced one of those delightful thrills
which comes to a fellow&#8217;s lot but once or twice
in a life-time. But it was not because I had
captured three at a strike, for I have done
that before and since, but I thrilled because
they were not only a new and strange kind
of trout, but they were of the color and sheen
of newly minted gold. Never before had any
man seen such trout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>I have since been informed that I had
blundered on to water inhabited by the rarest
of all game fish, the so-called golden trout,
which has since been discovered and which
scientists declare to be pre-glacier fish left
by some accident of nature to exist in a new
world in which all their original contemporaries
have long been extinct.</p>

<p>Think of it! Fish which had never seen an
artificial fly nor had any family traditions
of experiences with them. It is little wonder
that they would jump at a brown hackle, a
professor or even a gaudy salmon fly. Why
they would jump at a chicken feather! They
were ready and eager to bite at any sort of
bunco game I saw fit to play upon them.
They were veritable hayseeds of the trout
family, but when they felt the hook in their
lips, the wisest trout in the world could not
show a craftier nor half as plucky a fight.
They would leap from the water like small-mouthed
bass and by shaking their heads,
try to throw off the hateful hook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>The constant vigorous exercise of leaping
water-falls and forging up boiling rapids had
developed these sturdy mountaineer trout
into prodigies of strength and endurance.
Even now my nerves tingle to the tips of
my toes as in fancy I hear my reel hum or see
the tip of my five ounce split bamboo bend
so as to almost form a circle.</p>

<p>I fished that stream with hands trembling
with excitement and had filled my creel with
the rare fish before I began to notice other
objects of interest. Suddenly I became aware
of the presence of two birds hovering over and
diving under the cold water. They were
evidently feeding on some aquatic creature
which my duller senses could not discern.</p>

<p>Although they were the first of the kind
that I had ever seen alive, I at once recognized
the feathered visitors to be water ouzels.
The birds preceded me on my way along the
water course towards camp, and were never
quiet a minute. They would hop on a rock
in mid-stream and bob up and down in a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
solemn but comical manner for a moment
before plunging fearlessly into the cold white
spray of the falls or the swift dashing current,
where they would disappear below the surface
only to reappear once more on another rock to
bob again.</p>

<p>A ducking did not trouble the ouzels, for
as they came out of the water the liquid rolled
in crystal drops from their feathers and their
plumage was as dry as if it had never been
submerged. The wilder and swifter the cold
glacier water ran the more the birds seemed
to enjoy it.</p>

<p>The nearer I approached the edge of the
precipitous walls, enclosing the valley comprising
Big Pete&#8217;s park, the rougher grew the
trail, and as I was picking my way I paused
to gaze at the distant purple peaks and watch
the sun set in that lonely land as if I was
witnessing it for the first time. As my eyes
roamed over the stupendous distance and
unnamed mountains I felt my own puny
insignificance, as who has not when confronted
with the vastness of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>I turned from my view of the sunset to
retrace my steps to the valley, and peeping
over the top of a large boulder, saw seated
upon an inaccessible crag directly in front of
me, a gigantic figure of a man clad in a hunter&#8217;s
garb, and he was smoking a long cigar!</p>

<p>When I thought of Big Pete&#8217;s description
of how the Wild Hunter was wont to sit with
his long legs dangling from some rock while
he smoked one of those unprocurable cigars,
and when I realized that the figure before me
was fully sixty feet tall, I must confess to
experiencing a queer sensation.</p>

<p>It was a shadowy figure yet it moved,
arose, held out one hand, and a bird as large
as the fabled roc alighted on the wrist of the
outstretched hand.</p>

<p>A slight breeze sprang up, the white mists
from the valley rolled up the mountainside
and drifted away and the man and bird
disappeared from view.</p>

<p>It was long after dark when I reached camp
and was greeted by my friend and guide with
&#8220;Gol durn your pictur tenderfut, if it hain&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>

<p>&#8220;Little wonder,&#8221; thought I, &#8220;that the
Wild Hunter used golden bullets in a land
where even the fish&#8217;s scales seemed to be of
the same precious metal&#8221;; but I said nothing
as I sat down to clean my &#8220;yaller trout.&#8221;</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>It was always interesting to me when I
could get Pete&#8217;s theories and his brand of
philosophy on almost any subject and it was
my intention that night at supper to lead up
to the apparition I had seen on the cliffs that
day. With a substantial supper tucked away
I was in a better frame of mind to realize that
the illusion I had seen was not uncommon in
mountain districts. I recalled that I had
read of, and seen pictures of, a particular
illusion of this nature that is often present in
the Hartz Mountains in Germany and I knew
full well that the setting sun, the mist and the
atmospheric condition had all contributed
to throwing a greatly enlarged shadow of the
real Wild Hunter onto the screen made by the
mist very much as today a motion picture
increases the size of the small film image when
it is thrown on the movie screen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>I intended to get Big Pete&#8217;s idea on the
subject but I never did for I was not adroit
enough to steer the conversation in that
direction, for Big Pete seized my first statement
and made it a subject for a veritable
lecture.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a smashing lot of those trout
up there, Pete. Bet I could have brought
home all I could have carried if I had been a
game hog,&#8221; I said, as I stirred the fire with a
stick and set the coffee pot nearer the flames
to warm a second cup.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, tenderfut, it&#8217;s like this,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;when a man goes out to kill a deer for the
fun of blood-spilling or to get th&#8217; poor critter&#8217;s
head to hang in his shack, he&#8217;s nothing more
than a wolf or butcher; hain&#8217;t half as good a
man as the one who never shot a deer, but
goes back home and lies about it. The liar
hain&#8217;t harmed nothin&#8217; with his lies. His
fairy stories don&#8217;t hurt game an&#8217; they be
interesting to the tenderfuts in the States.
The real sportsman is the pot-hunter. Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
that&#8217;s jist what I mean, a pot-hunter&mdash;he&#8217;s
out &#8217;cause the camp kettle is empty, and it&#8217;s
up agin him to fill it or starve. Now then,
this fellow is not after blood; nor trophies, nor
is he hunting for the market. It&#8217;s self-preservation
with him, that&#8217;s what it is.
He&#8217;s an animal along with the rest of &#8217;em and
he knows he&#8217;s got jest as much a right to
live as tha&#8217; have and no more! He&#8217;s hustling
for his living along with the bunch, forcing it
from savage nature, and I tell you boy, there
is no greater physical pleasure in life than
holding old Mother Nature up and just
saying to her, &#8216;You&#8217;ve got a living for me,
ole&#8217; gal, and I&#8217;m going to get it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such talk pleases the old lady, makes her
your friend &#8217;cause she likes your spunk, and
because of it she&#8217;ll give you the wind of a grey
wolf, the step of the panther, the strength of
the buffalo and the courage of a lion. She is
always generous with her favorites. Ah!
lad, she kin make your blood dance in your
veins, make fire flash from your eyes and give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
you the steady nerve necessary to face a
she-grizzly when she is fightin&#8217; for her cubs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? &#8217;cause you see, you are a grizzly
yourself when the camp kettle is empty!&#8221;
And Big Pete relapsed into silence, turned his
attention to his tin platter, examining it
carefully, and then with a piece of dough-god,
carefully wiped the platter clean and contentedly
munched the savory bit.</p>

<p>The reason, that being locked into Big Pete&#8217;s
park in the mountains struck me as being very
serious, was because I realized that although
the park was extensive it was completely
surrounded by a practically unsurmountable
barrier of rugged cliffs and mountains negotiable,
as far as I knew, not even by the sure-footed
mountain sheep and goats which we
could occasionally see on the cliffs from the
valley floor, but never saw in the park itself.
I questioned Big Pete and found that he did
not know of a trail up the cliffs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there must be some
sort of a one for that tha&#8217; Wild Hunter gits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
in an&#8217; out and brings his wolf pack along too.
He knows a trail all right an&#8217; ef he knows it
why it&#8217;s up to us to find it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we can trail him,&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trail him! Me? With that wolf pack
clingin&#8217; to his heels? Not while I&#8217;m alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the last that was said about trailing
the Wild Hunter for some time to come,
but meanwhile we built a more or less open
faced permanent camp and Big Pete initiated
me into mysteries of real woodcraft, for it was
up to us now to live on the land, so to speak.</p>

<p>Although hard usage had made havoc with
my tailormade clothes, neither time nor the
elements seemed to affect the personal appearance
of my big companion; his buckskin suit
was apparently as clean and fresh as it was on
the day I first met him. There was no magic
in this. Big Pete knew how to clamber all
day through a windfall without leaving the
greater part of his clothes on the branches, a
feat few hunters and no tenderfoot have yet
been able to accomplish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>As I have already said, Pete was a dude,
but he was what might be called a self-perpetuating
dude, who never ran to seed no
matter how long he might be separated from
the city tailor shops, for Pete was his own
tailor, barber and valet, and the wilderness
supplied the material for his costume.</p>

<p>In the camp he was as busy as an old
housewife, and occupied his leisure time
mending, stitching and darning. Many a
morning my own toilet consisted of a face
wash at the spring, but my guide seldom
failed to spend as much time prinking as if he
expected distinguished visitors!</p>

<p>Instead of &#8220;Tenderfoot,&#8221; Big Pete now
called me &#8220;Le-loo,&#8221; which I understand is
Chinook for wolf and I took so much pride in
my promotion that I would not have changed
clothes with the Prince of Wales; I gloried in
my wild, unkempt appearance!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Big Pete announced that he
was the Hy-as-ty-ee (big boss) and he forthwith
declared that my costume was unsuitable for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the approaching cold weather. There was
no disputing that Big Pete was Hy-as-ty-ee
and I agreed to wear whatever clothes he
should make for me, and can say with no fear
of dispute that if that ancient chump, Robinson
Crusoe, had had a Big Pete for a partner
in place of a man Friday, he would have never
made himself his outlandish goatskin clothes
and a clumsy umbrella.</p>

<p>From a cache in the rocks Pete brought forth
a miscellaneous lot of trappers&#8217; stores, bone
needles made from the splints of deer&#8217;s legs,
elk&#8217;s teeth with holes bored through them,
and odds and ends of all kinds.</p>

<p>Among his stuff was a supply of salt-petre
and alum, and this was evidently the material
for which he was searching for he at once
preceeded to make a mixture of two parts
salt-petre to one of alum and applied the
pulverized compound to the fleshy side of the
skins, then doubling the raw side of the hides
together he rolled them closely and placed the
hides in a cool place where they were allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to remain for several days; when at length
unrolled, the skins were still moist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just right, by Gosh,&#8221; he exclaimed, as he
took a dull knife and carefully removed all
particles of fat or flesh which here and there
adhered to the hide. After this was done
to his satisfaction we both took hold and
rubbed, and mauled and worked the skins with
our hands until the hides were as soft and as
pliable as flannel. Thus was the material for
my winter clothing prepared.</p>

<p>It took four whole deer-skins to furnish
stuff for my buckskin shirt with the beautiful
long fringes at the seams; but the whole garment
was cut, sewed and finished in a day&#8217;s
time. It was sewed with thread made of
sinew.</p>

<p>When it came to making the coat and trousers
Big Pete spent a long time in solemn
thought before he was ready to begin work on
these garments; at length he looked up with a
broad smile and cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Le-loo, I have taken a fancy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
them &#8217;ere tenderfut pants o&#8217; your&#8217;n. Off with
&#8217;em now an&#8217; I&#8217;ll jist cut out the new ones from
the old uns.&#8221; In vain I pleaded with him to
make my trousers like his own; he would not
listen to me, he insisted upon having my ragged
but stylish knickerbockers to use as a pattern.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>Big Pete was an expert backwoods tailor,
shoemaker and shirtmaker, but these were
but few of his accomplishments, not his trade;
he was first, last and aways a hunter and
scout. No matter what occupation seemed
to engage his attention for the time it never
interfered with his ability to hear, see or smell.</p>

<p>It was while I was going around camp minus
my lower garments that I saw Pete suddenly
throw up his head and suspiciously sniff the
air, at the same time sharply scanning the
windward side of our camp. Living so long
with this strange man made me familiar with
his actions and quick to detect anything
unusual and I now knew that something of
interest had happened. To the windward and
close by us was a mound thickly covered with
bullberry bushes and underbrush, and so far
as could be seen there was nothing suspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in the appearance of the thicket. Fixing my
eyes on Big Pete, I saw a peculiar expression
spread over his face which seemed to be half
of mirth and half of wonderment, and I
immediately knew that his wonderful nose
had warned him of the presence of something
to the windward.</p>

<p>Slowly and quietly he laid aside my almost
finished breeches and silently stole away.
It was only a few minutes before he returned
with a very solemn face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doggone my corn shucked bones, Le-loo,
we&#8217;ve had a visitor but it got away mighty
slick and quick. I hain&#8217;t determint yit
whether it wa&#8217; man er beast er both, er jist a
thing wha&#8217; might change into &#8217;tother. We&#8217;ll
hafter investigate later. Here git these duds
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I put on my new elk-hide knickerbockers
with cuffs of dressed buckskin laced
around my calves, and my beautiful soft
buckskin shirt tucked in at the waist I began
to feel like a real Nimrod, but after I added my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
&#8220;Moo-loch-Capo,&#8221; the shooting jacket with
elk-teeth buttons, pulled a pair of shank
moccasins over my feet and donned a cap
made of lynx skin, I was as happy as a child
with its Christmas stocking. It was a really
wonderful suit of clothing; the hair of the elk
hide was on the outside, and not only made the
coat and breeches warmer, but helped to shed
the rain. The buttons of the elk-teeth were
fastened on with thongs run through holes in
their centers, and my coat could be laced up
after the fashion of a military overcoat. The
elk&#8217;s teeth served as frogs and loops of rawhide
answered for the braid that is used on military
coats.</p>

<p>My shank moccasins were made by first
making a cut around each of the hind legs of an
elk, at a sufficient distance above the heels to
leave hide enough for boot legs and making
another cut far enough below the heels to
make room for one&#8217;s feet. The fresh skins
when peeled off looked like rude stockings with
holes at the toes. The skins were turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
wrong side out, and the open toes closed by
bringing the lower part, or sole, up over the
opening and sewing it there after the manner of
a tip to the modern shoe. When this novel
foot-gear was dry enough for the purpose,
Big Pete ornamented the legs with quaint
colored designs made with split porcupine
quills colored with dyes which Pete himself
had manufactured of roots and barks.</p>

<p>Dressed in my unique and picturesque
costume I stood upright while Pete surveyed
me with the pride and satisfaction of one who
had done a fine piece of work. I had now little
fear of being called a tenderfoot and when I
viewed my reflection in the spring I felt quite
proud of my appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along now old scout,&#8221; said Pete
viewing me with the pride of an artist, &#8220;come
along and let me test you on a real trail.
I want to see what my teaching has done for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pete led me through the underbrush to a
point among the rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>&#8220;Tha&#8217;. A trail begins right under yore
nose; let&#8217;s see what you make of it,&#8221; he said
crisply.</p>

<p>Down on all fours I crept over the ground
and, to my surprise and joy, I found that I
could here and there detect a turned leaf the
twist of which indicated the direction taken
by the party who made the trail. I noticed
that the bits of wood, pine cones and sticks
scattered around were darker on the parts
next to the ground, and it only required
simple reasoning for me to conclude that
when the dark side was uppermost the object
had been recently disturbed and rolled over.</p>

<p>It was a day of great discoveries. I found
that what is true of the sticks is equally true
of the pebbles and a displaced fragment of
stone immediately caught my eyes. With
the tenacity of a bloodhound I stuck to my task
until I suddenly found myself at the base of
the park wall, at the foot of the diagonal
fracture in the face of the cliff where I had
climbed when I discovered the golden trout.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
As I have said, the fracture led diagonally up
the towering face of the beetling precipice.</p>

<p>For fear that I might have made some
mistake I carefully retraced my steps backward
toward the bullberry bushes near the
camp. On the back trail I came upon some
distinct and obvious footprints in a dusty
place, but so deeply interested was I in hidden
signs, the slight but tell-tale disturbances of
leaf and soil, that I once passed these plainly
marked tracks with only a glance and would
have done so the second time had not their
marked peculiarities accidentally caught my
attention.</p>

<p>When examining the trail of this mysterious
camp visitor I suddenly realized that in place
of moccasin footprints I was following bear
tracks, my heart ceased to beat for a moment
or two before I could pull myself together and
smother the prehensile footed superstitious
old savage in me with the practical philosophy
of the up-to-date man of today.</p>

<p>Taking a short cut I ran back to the foot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the pass and there, on hands and knees,
ascended for a hundred feet or more&mdash;the
bear steps led up the pass, and yet at the
beginning of the trail the feet wore moccasins.
This I knew because at one place the foot-mark
showed plainly in the gray alkali dust
which had accumulated upon a projecting
stone a few feet below the ledge. Obviously
whoever the visitor was, he had entered and
left by this pass. Returning to camp I sat
down on a log lost in thought. My reverie
was at last broken by the voice of my guide
quietly remarking. &#8220;Well, Le-loo, what&#8217;s
your judication?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pete,&#8221; I said, &#8220;that bear walks on its
hind-legs; there is not the sign of a forefoot
anywhere along the trail. Now this could
not be caused by the hind feet obliterating
the tracks of the front feet, because in many
places the pass is so steep that the forefeet
in reaching out for support would make
tracks not overlapped by the hind ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, Le-loo; sartin true. If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
live to be a hundred years you&#8217;ll make as
good a trailer as the great Greaser trailer of
New Mexico, Dolores Sanchez, or my old
friend Bill Hassler, who could follow a six-month-old
trail,&#8221; replied my guide. &#8220;But,&#8221;
he continued, &#8220;maybe witch-bears do walk on
their hind legs same as people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Witch be blamed!&#8221; I cried impatiently;
&#8220;this is no four-legged witch nor bear either.
That was a man and when he thought he
would be followed he put on moccasins made
from bears&#8217; paws to leave a disguised trail.
And moreover I believe that man is none other
than the Wild Hunter without his wolf pack.
And that pass is the pathway he takes in and
out of this park. I&#8217;m going to trail him
whether you want to or not. Goodbye Pete,
I&#8217;ll come back for you,&#8221; and picking up my gun
and other necessary traps, I prepared to start
immediately upon my journey, for I felt that
to follow this trail would not only get us out of
our park prison but would lead me to the
abode of the Wild Hunter, where perhaps I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
could talk with him and learn some of the
things I was so eager to know about my
parents.</p>

<p>Big Pete looked at me solemnly for a while,
ran over the cartridges in his belt and went
through all those familiar unconscious motions
which betokened danger ahead, and said,
&#8220;Le-loo, you are a quare critter; you&#8217;re not
afraid of all the werwolves, medicine ba&#8217;rs and
ghosts in this world or the next, but tarnally
afeared of live varmints like grizzly bars&mdash;one
would think you had no religion, but, gosh all
hemlock! If you can face a bear-man or a
werwolf, even though all the Hy-as Ecutocks
of the mountains show fight, I&#8217;ll be cornfed
if I don&#8217;t stand by ye! Barring the Wild
Hunter, I don&#8217;t know as I ever ran agin a
Ecutock yit; that is if he be a Ecutock.
Maybe he&#8217;s a Econe? Yes, I reckon that&#8217;s
what he is,&#8221; continued Pete reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he is a pine cone,&#8221; I laughed.
Then added, &#8220;Whatever he is, he knows the
way out of this park of yours and I am going
to follow him,&#8221; I emphatically answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s howsomever!&#8221; exclaimed my guide
approvingly; &#8220;but,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;the mountains
are kivered with snow, while it is still
summer down here, so I reckon &#8217;twould be
the proper wrinkle for us to pull our things
together, have a good feed and a good sleep
before we start. White men start off hot-headed
and I kinder like their grit, but Injuns
stop and sot by the fire an&#8217; smoke an&#8217; think
afore they start on a raid an&#8217; I kinder think
they be wiser in this than we &#8217;uns, so let&#8217;s do
as the Injuns would do. We can cache most
of our stuff and turn the horses loose. Bighorn&#8217;s
mutton is powerful good, but tarnally
shy and hung mighty high, an&#8217; billygoat is
doggoned strong &#8217;nless you know how to cook
&#8217;em. Yes, we&#8217;ll eat an sleep fust an&#8217; then
his for the land where the Bighorn pasture,
the woolywhite goats sleep on the rocks, the
whistling marmot blows his danger signal an&#8217;
the pretty white ptarmigan hides hisself in
the snow-banks, the home of the Ecutocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the thunder is a Ecutock, Pete?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>&#8220;An Injun devil, I reckon you&#8217;d call it;
it&#8217;s bad medicine,&#8221; he answered soberly, and
continuing in his former strain, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whar critters like goats, sheeps and rock-chucks
kin live, you bet your Hy-as muck-a-muck
we kin live too!&#8221;</p>

<p>That night I rolled up into my blanket,
filled with strange presentiments. Again the
question came up: What is the source of the
influence that this madman of the mountains,
this wild hunter, this leader of the black wolf
pack, had on me to impel me to trail him over
the mountains? Was it mental telepathy?
Could he really be my father? Somehow I
felt convinced that soon I would be face to
face with the riddle, soon I would know the
facts and the truth about my parents. It
seemed unthinkable that all these weeks of
wilderness travel had been for naught and
that the Wild Hunter was nothing but a
strange, eccentric old fellow living alone in
the mountains and of no interest to me
whatsoever.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>We made our start at daylight, loaded with
all the necessities for a climb over the mountains.
The rest of our supplies and equipment
we cached, and Big Pete turned our horses
loose assuring me that in the spring he would
come back and rope them.</p>

<p>The lower trail of the pass was quite well
defined and we made famous progress, but
the higher we climbed the more difficult the
going became and more than once we were
forced to pause on a ledge to rest and regain
our breath.</p>

<p>On one ledge I got my first really close view
of a bighorn sheep, and I became so excited
that nothing would do but I must stalk him,
despite Big Pete&#8217;s assurance that the wily
old ram would not let me get within gun shot
of him in such an exposed area.</p>

<p>I crawled, and wriggled, and twisted over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
rock and boulders for what to me seemed miles,
but always the sheep kept just out of accurate
shooting distance ahead of me. It was an
exasperating chase, but one cannot live in
the mountains for any length of time without
paying more or less attention to geology; the
mountaineer soon learns that stratified rock,
that is rock arranged like layer cake, resting
in a horizontal position on its natural bed,
makes travel over its top comparatively easy,
but when by the subsidence or upheaval of
the earth&#8217;s crust huge masses of stone have
been tilted up edgewise, it is an entirely
different proposition.</p>

<p>In this latter case the erosion, or the wearing
away, caused by trickling water, frost and
snow, sharpens the edge of the rock, as a
grindstone does the edge of an ax, and traveling
along one of these ridges presents almost the
same difficulties that travel along the edge of
an upturned ax would do to a microscopic man.</p>

<p>But when a sportsman, for the first time in
his life, has succeeded in creeping within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
range of a grand bighorn ram, and his bullet,
speeding true, has badly wounded the game,
hardships are forgotten, and if, on account
of the miraculous vitality of the mountain
sheep, there is danger of losing the quarry,
all the inborn instinct of the predaceous
beast in man&#8217;s nature is aroused, and danger
is a consideration not to be taken in account.</p>

<p>A hawk in pursuit of a barnyard fowl will
follow it into the open door of the farmhouse;
the hound in pursuit of the fox cares not for
the approaching locomotive&mdash;being possessed
by the instinct to kill&mdash;nothing is of importance
to them but the capture of the game in
sight. A man following a buck is governed
by a like singleness of purpose.</p>

<p>For this reason I was scrambling along the
knife-like edge of the ridge, with death in the
steep treacherous slide rock on one side,
death in the steep green glacier ice on the
other side, and torture and wounds under my
feet.</p>

<p>But the fever of the chase had possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of me. I had tasted blood and felt the fierce
joy of the puma and the wild intoxication of a
hunting wolf!</p>

<p>The cruel wounds inflicted by the sharp
stones under my feet were unnoticed. Away
ahead of me was a moving object; it could
use but three legs, but that was one leg more
than I had, and the ram had distanced me.
After an age of time I reached the rugged,
broader footing of the mountain side, and
creeping up behind some sheltering rocks again
fired at the fleeing ram. With the impact of
the bullet the sheep fell headlong down
a cliff to a projecting rock thirty feet below,
where it lay apparently dead. A moment
later it again arose, seemingly as able as ever,
and ran along the face of the beetling rock
where my eyes, aided by powerful field glasses,
could perceive no foothold; then it gave a
magnificent leap to a ledge on the opposite
side of the narrow canyon and fell dead, out
of my reach.</p>

<p>Spent with my long, rough run, I naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
selected the most comfortable seat in which to
rest; this chanced to be a cushion of heather-like
plants along the side of a fragment of
rock which effectually concealed my body from
view from the other side of the chasm. Here,
on the verge of that impassable canyon, I sat
panting and looking at the poor dead creature
upon the opposite side; its right front leg was
shattered at the shoulder, a bullet had pierced
its lungs. Yet, with two fatal wounds and a
useless leg, the plucky creature had scaled
the face of a cliff which one would think a
squirrel would find impossible to traverse
and made leaps which might well be considered
improbable for a perfectly sound animal.
The ram was dead and food for the ravens,
and a reaction had taken place in my mind;
I felt like a bloody murderer, and hung my
head with a sense of guilt.</p>

<p>Presently, becoming conscious of that peculiar
guttural noise, used by Big Pete when
desiring caution, and looking up I was amazed
to see a splendid Indian youth climb down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
face of the opposite cliff, throw his arms around
the dead ram&#8217;s neck and burst into deep but
subdued lamentation. For the first time I now
saw that what I had mistaken for a blood
stain on the bighorn&#8217;s neck was a red collar.</p>

<p>Cautiously producing my field glasses I
examined the collar and discovered it to be
made of stained porcupine quills cleverly
worked on a buckskin band. The field glasses
also told me that the boy&#8217;s shirt was trimmed
with the same material, while a duplicate
of the sheep&#8217;s collar formed a band which
encircled his head, confining the long black
hair and preventing it from falling over his
face, but leaving it free to hang down his back
to a point below the waist line.</p>

<p>So absorbed was I in this unique spectacle
that I carelessly allowed my elbow to dislodge
a loose fragment of stone which went clattering
down the face of the precipice. This proved
to be almost fatal carelessness, for, with a
movement as quick as the stroke of a rattlesnake,
the lad placed an arrow to the string<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of a bow and sent the barbed shaft with such
force, promptitude and precision that it went
through my fur cap, the arrow entangling a
bunch of my hair, taking it along with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Squat lower, Le-loo; arrows has been the
death of many a man afore you,&#8221; whispered
Big Pete in my ear, but even as he spoke
another arrow sang over our crouching bodies,
shaving the protecting rock so closely that
their plumed tips brushed the dust on our
backs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waugh! Good shootin&#8217;, by gum! I never
seed it beat; if he onct sots them black eyes
on our hulking carcasses he&#8217;ll get us yit,&#8221;
muttered my guide, enthusiastically. &#8220;He&#8217;s
mighty slender, quick and purty&mdash;but so also
be a rattlesnake!&#8221; he exclaimed, as another
arrow slit the sleeve of his wamus as cleanly
as if it were cut with a knife.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, stop!&#8221; I shouted, in real
alarm. The boy paused, but with an arrow
still drawn to its head. His eyes flashing,
head erect, one moccasined foot on the ram&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
body, the other braced against the cliff; his
short fawn-colored skin shirt clung to his
lithe body, and the fringed edges hung over
the dreadful black chasm in front of him.
It was a picture to take away one&#8217;s breath.
&#8220;Put down your weapon, and we will stand
with our hands up,&#8221; I cried. Slowly the bow
was lowered and as slowly Big Pete and I
arose, holding our empty hands aloft. &#8220;Now,
young fellow, tell us your pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are a few gray hairs showing at my
temples which first made their appearance
while I was crouching behind that stone on
the edge of the chasm.</p>

<p>To my polite inquiry asking his pleasure,
the wild boy made no reply but glanced at us
with the utmost contempt when Big Pete
went through some gestures in Indian sign
language. The lad mutely pointed to the
dead sheep, the sight of which seemed to
enrage him again, for insensibly his fingers
tightened on the bow and the wood began to
curve after a manner which sent me ducking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
behind the sheltering stone again; but Big
Pete only folded his arms across his broad
chest and looked the boy straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>Never will I forget that picture, the cold,
bleak, snow-covered mountains towering above
them, the black abyss of Sheol between them;
neither would hesitate to take life, neither
possessed a fear of death; but with every
muscle alert and every nerve alive these two
wild things stood facing each other, mutually
observing a truce because of&mdash;what? Because,
in spite of the fighting instinct or, maybe,
because of it they both secretly admired each
other.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>The black chasm which separated us from
the trail of the wild hunter was not as formidable
a barrier as the unfathomable abyss
which separates the reader from what he thinks
he would have done had he been in my place,
and what really would have been his plan of
action.</p>

<p>There were a lot of burning questions which
I had privately made up in my mind to propound
to the Wild Hunter, or the even wilder
medicine bear, upon the occasion of our next
meeting. But when the lad was standing
before me, with bended bow and flashing
eyes, the burning importance of those questions
did not appeal to me as forcibly as did
the urgent necessity of sheltering my body
behind the friendly stone. To be truthful, it
must be admitted that the proposed inquiries
were, for the time, entirely forgotten, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
I even breathed a sigh of relief when the boy
suddenly clambered up the face of the cliff,
turned, gave us a fierce look of defiance, made
some quick energetic gestures with his hand
and disappeared.</p>

<p>He scaled that precipitous rock with the
rapidity and self-confidence of a gray squirrel
running up the trunk of a hickory tree, squirrel-like,
taking advantage of every crack, cranny
and projection that could be grasped by
fingers or moccasin-covered toes.</p>

<p>Not until the Indian had disappeared down
a dry coulee did I venture from the shelter
of the protecting rock, or realize that my
carefully planned interview must be indefinitely
postponed.</p>

<p>With his arms folded across his chest, his
blond hair sweeping his shoulders, his blue
eyes fixed upon a rocky rib of the mountain
behind which the boy had disappeared, Big
Pete still stood like a statue. But gradually
the statuesque pose resolved itself into a
more commonplace posture, and the muscles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of the face relaxed until the familiar twinkle
hovered around the corners of his eyes.
&#8220;What did he say when he made those
motions, Pete?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waugh! he said he was not afraid of any
whitefaced coyote like us.&#8221; And bringing
forth his pipe, Pete filled it from the beaded
tobacco pouch which hung on his breast, and
by means of a horn of punk, a flint and steel,
he soon had the pipe aglow and was puffing
away as calmly as if nothing unusual had
occurred. Presently he exclaimed, &#8220;Gol durn
his daguerrotype, what good did it do him to
throw that sheep down the gulch? Reckon
Le-loo and me could find a better grave for
mutton chops than that canyon bottom. The
mountains didn&#8217;t need the sheep an&#8217; we did.
But, I reckon it was his own sheep you killed,
&#8217;cause it had a porcupine collar same pattern
as the trimmings of his shirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning his great blue eyes full upon me,
he suddenly shot this inquiry, &#8220;Be he bar,
ecutock or werwolf?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>&#8220;He is the finest adjusted, easiest running,
most exquisitely balanced, highest geared bit
of human machinery I ever saw,&#8221; I answered
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall, maybe ye are right, Le-loo, an&#8217;
maybe ye hain&#8217;t; which is catamount to
saying, maybe it is a man and maybe it
tain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, Pete, old fellow, let us go slow;
now tell me at what you&#8217;re driving?&#8221; I
pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks to me this hea&#8217;-a-way,&#8221; he
explained. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seed his trail onct or twice,
an&#8217; I&#8217;ve seed him onct, but I never yet seed
his trail and the Wild Hunter&#8217;s trail at the
same time and place. &#8217;Pears to me that
a man who, when it&#8217;s convenient, kin make
a wolf of hisself, might likewise make a boy
of hisself whenever he felt that way. Never
heared tell on enny real laid who cud climb
like a squtton and shoot a bow better nor
a Robin Hood or Injun, and that&#8217;s howsomever!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>&#8220;Well, it does look &#8216;howsomever,&#8217; and no
mistake,&#8221; I admitted, &#8220;and what makes it
worse, our dinner is at the bottom of this
infernal gulch. Come, let us be moving; the
breeze from the snowfields chills me. Let us
hit his trail now while it is fresh.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a simple proposition to make, but
a difficult one to carry into execution; for to
all appearances that trail began upon the
other side of the chasm, and there was no
bridge in sight by which we could cross.
Big Pete carefully put a cork-stopper in his
pipe, extinguishing the fire without wasting
the unconsumed contents; he then carefully
put his briarwood away and began to uncoil
a lariat from around his middle. As he
loosened the braided rawhide from his waist his
gaze was roaming over the opposite rocks.
Presently he fixed his attention upon a pinnacle
which reared its cube-like form above
the top of the opposite side of the chasm; the
latter was of itself much higher than the brink
upon which we stood. Swinging the loop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
around his head he sent it whistling across the
chasm, where it settled and encircled the
projecting stone, the honda striking the face
of the cliff with a sullen thud. The rope
tightened, but when we both threw our
weight on our end of the lariat to try it, the
cube-like pinnacle moved on its base.</p>

<p>&#8220;I oughter knowed better than to try to
lasso a piece of slide rock,&#8221; said Pete in
disgusted tones, as he cast the end of the
braided rawhide loose and watched it for a
moment dangling down the opposite side of
the canyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Le-loo, we must get over this hole or
lose the best lariat in the Rocky Mountains.
We kin look for that boy&#8217;s trail on this side,
for even if he be an Ecutock, I&#8217;ll bet my crooker
bone &#8217;gainst a lock of his hair that he can&#8217;t
jump th&#8217; hole, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll wager my left ear that
he&#8217;s got a trail an&#8217; a bridge somewhar&mdash;&#8217;nless
he turns bird and flops over things like
this,&#8221; he added, with a troubled look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pete,&#8221; said I, &#8220;never mind the bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
business. I&#8217;ll admit that there is a lot of
explanation due us before we can rightly
judge on the events of the past few weeks;
still I think it may all be explained in a
rational manner; but what if it cannot?
We have but one trip to make through this
world, and the more we see the more we will
know at the end of the journey. I am as
curious as a prong-horned antelope when
there is a mystery, so put your nose to the
ground, my good friend, and find the spot
where this Mr. Werwolf, witch, or bear
flies the canyon, and maybe, like the husband
of &#8216;The Witch of Fife,&#8217; we may find the
&#8216;black crook shell,&#8217; and with its aid fly out
of this &#8217;lum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe your judication is sound, Le-loo;
stay where you be an&#8217; if he hain&#8217;t a witch
I&#8217;ll bet my front tooth agin the string of his
moccasin that I&#8217;ll find the bridge, and I&#8217;ll
swear by my grandmother&#8217;s hind leg that that
little imp will pay for our sheep yit.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Pete finished these remarks there was a
sudden and astonishing change in his appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
His head fell forward, his shoulders
drooped, his back bowed and his knee bent.
It was no longer the upright statuesque
Pete the Mountaineer, but Peter the Trailer,
all of whose faculties were concentrated upon
the ground. With a swinging gait the human
bloodhound traveled swiftly and silently along
the edge of the crevasse, noting every bunch
of moss, fragment of stone, drift of snow or bit
of moist earth, reading the shorthand notes of
Nature with facility which far excelled the
ability of my own stenographer to read her
own notes when the latter are a few hours
old. But a short time had elapsed before I
heard a shout, and, hurrying to the place where
my big friend was seated, I inquired, &#8220;Any
luck?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tha&#8217;s as you may call it. Here is wha&#8217;
tha&#8217; boy jumped,&#8221; he replied, pointing to
some marks on the stone which were imperceptible
to me, &#8220;an&#8217; tha&#8217;s wha&#8217; he landed,&#8221;
he continued, pointing to a slight ledge upon
the face of the opposite cliff at least twenty
feet distant. &#8220;He&#8217;s a jumper, an&#8217; no mistake&mdash;guess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
I might as well have my front tooth
pulled, fur I&#8217;ve lost my bet,&#8221; soliloquized
the trailer, as he sat on the edge of the cliff,
with his legs hanging over the frightful chasm.</p>

<p>The ledge indicated by Big Pete as the
landing place of the phenomenal jumper might
possibly have offered a foothold for a bighorn
or goat, but I could not believe that any
human being could jump twenty feet to a
crumbling trifle of a ledge on the face of a
precipice, and not only retain a foothold
there, but run up the face of the rock like a
fly on a window-pane. Yet I could see that
something had worn the ledge at the point
indicated and when I stood a little distance
away from the trail I could plainly note a
difference in color marking the course of the
trail where it led over the flinty rocks to the
jumping place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wull, Le-loo! What&#8217;s your opinion of
the Ecutock now? Do he use wings or ride
a barleycorn broom?&#8221; asked Pete, with a
triumphant smile.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>Apparently there was no possible way by
which we might hope to cross the canyon,
and I threw myself prone upon the top of the
stony brink of the chasm and peered down the
awful abyss at the silver thread, shining in
the gloom of the shadows, which marked the
course of a stream, and wondered what the
Boy Scouts of Troop 6 of Marlborough
would do under the circumstances.</p>

<p>I studied the face of the opposite cliff in a
vain search for some hint to the solution of
the problem before us, looking up and down
from side to side as far as allowed by the
range of my vision. At length my attention
wandered to the perpendicular face of the
cliff, on the top of which my body was
sprawled; there was an upright crack in the
face of the stone wall, and as I examined the
fracture I saw that a piece of wood had lodged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in the crack; a piece of wood in a crevice in a
rock is not so unusual an occurrence as to
excite remark; but when it occurred to me
that we were then far above the timber line,
my interest and curiosity were at once
aroused.</p>

<p>The end of the stick was within a short
distance from my hand, and reaching down
I grasped the wood and brought forth, not a
short club or stick, as I thought to be concealed
there, but a very long pole. The result
of my investigations was so unexpected that
I came dangerously near allowing the thing
to slide through my fingers and fall to the
bottom of the canyon. It was a neatly-smoothed,
slender piece of lodge-pole pine
which was brought to view, and it had a
crooked root nicely spliced to one end and
bound tightly in place with rawhide thongs.
Big Pete was wholly absorbed in the trail,
the study of which he had resumed, and
when I looked up he was down on all fours,
minutely studying the ground. Presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
he cried, &#8220;Le-loo, tha&#8217; pesky lad ha&#8217; been
over wha&#8217; you be after sompen and he took
it back tha&#8217; again afore he made his jump!
If you&#8217;re any good you&#8217;ll find what the lad
was after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was after his barleycorn broomstick,&#8221;
I replied, proudly, &#8220;and here it is, although
I must confess it is a pretty long one for a
fellow of his size, and it looks more like a
giant Bo-Peep&#8217;s crook than a witch&#8217;s broom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Big Pete eagerly snatched the pole from
my hands and examined it carefully. At
length he said, &#8220;This hyer is the end used for
the handle; one can see by the finger marks,
an&#8217; this crook is used to scrape stone with,
one kin see, with half an eye, by the way the
end is sandpapered off. Over tha&#8217; air some
marks on the stone which look almighty like
as if they&#8217;d been made by the end of this yer
hook slipping down the face of the rock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I wonder wha&#8217; cud be up tha&#8217; on
the top of the rock that the boy wanted,&#8221;
mused Big Pete, and for a moment or so he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
stood in silent thought; at length he exclaimed,
&#8220;Why, bless my corn-shucking soul, if I
don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s got a lariat staked out tha&#8217;
an&#8217; crosses this ditch same as we-uns aimed
to do!&#8221; With that he began raking and
scraping the top of the opposite rock with the
shepherd&#8217;s crook, and presently there came
tumbling and twisting like a snake down the
face of the cliff, a long braided rawhide rope
with a loop at the bottom end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waugh, Le-loo! tha&#8217;s no witchcraft &#8217;bout
this &#8217;cep the magic of common-sense; but
we hain&#8217;t through with him yit!&#8221; By this
time Pete had the end of the rawhide rope
in his hands and was testing the strength of its
anchorage upon the opposite cliff. The point
where it was fastened projected some distance
over the ledge, where the supposed landing-place
was located, thus making it possible for
one to swing at the end of the rope from our
side without danger of coming into too violent
contact with the opposite cliff.</p>

<p>As soon as my big friend was satisfied that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the rope was safe he grasped it with his two
hands, and with one foot in the loop and the
other free to use as a fender, he sailed across
the abyss and landed safely upon the crumbling
ledge opposite.</p>

<p>Holding fast to the rawhide rope with his
hands and bracing his feet against the rock,
Pete could walk up the face of the cliff by
going hand-over-hand up the cable at the
same time. He had almost reached the top
when I was horror-stricken to see a small
hand and brown arm reach over the precipice;
but it was neither the grace nor the beauty
of this shapely bit of anatomy which sent the
blood surging to my heart, but the fact that
the cold gray glint of a long-bladed knife
caught my eyes and fascinated me with the
fabled &#8220;charm&#8221; of a serpent. The power
of speech forsook me, but with great effort I
succeeded in giving utterance to the inarticulate
noise people gurgle when confronted in
their sleep by a shapeless horror. Big Pete
heard the noise, but he was not unnerved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
when he saw the knife, neither did he show
any nightmare symptoms, although he was
dangling over the terrible abyss with a full
knowledge that it needed but a touch of the
keen blade of that knife to sever the straining
lariat and dash him, a mangled mass, on the
rocks below. The danger was too real to give
Pete the nightmare; there was nothing spooky
to him in the glittering knife blade, and only
ghosts and the supernatural could give Big
Pete the nightmare. Calmly he looked at
the hand grasping the power of death with its
strong tapering fingers. Suddenly and in a
firm, commanding voice he gave the order,
&#8220;Drap tha&#8217; knife!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ever since I had been in the company of
this masterful forest companion I had obeyed
his commands as a matter of course, and so
was not surprised to see the fingers instantly
relax their grasp and the knife go gyrating to
the mysterious depths. In a few moments
Big Pete was up and over the edge of the
rock and hidden from my view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>Seizing the long-handled shepherd&#8217;s crook,
I caught the dangling end of the lariat, and
was soon scrambling up the face of the cliff,
leaving a trail which the veriest novice would
not fail to notice and sending showers of the
crumbling stones down the path taken by the
knife; it was several minutes before I had
clambered over the face of the projecting crag
and was safe across the black chasm which
lay athwart our trail.</p>

<p>If the Wild Hunter was indeed my father,
he certainly was a woodcrafter and scout to
bring pride to a fellow&#8217;s heart, for I doubted
not that the Indian boy was his retainer
because the porcupine quill decorations on
his buckskin shirt had the same peculiar
pattern as that on the wamus of the Wild
Hunter himself as well as on the collar of the
pet sheep I had killed, and also on the buckskin
bag of gold.</p>

<p>Only those persons who have made solitary
trips over snow-capped mountain ridges can
appreciate the overwhelming feeling of solitude
that I felt on looking about me. To whatever
point of view I turned my eyes were greeted
with a tumbled sea composed of stupendous
petrified billows.</p>

<p>The occasional fields of snow were the white
froth of the stony waves and the turquoise
colored glacial lakes between the crags rather
added to the effect of an angry ocean than
detracted from it.</p>

<p>On a closer examination, some of the rocks
appeared to be rough bits of unfinished worlds
still retaining the form they had when poured
from the mighty blast furnaces of the Creator.
It was God&#8217;s workshop strewn with huge
fragments, still bearing the marks of His
mallet and chisel; yet these cold barren
wastes were the pasture lands of the shaggy-coated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
white goats and the lithe-limbed bighorned
sheep.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shrill whistle pierced the air
and with a jump I instinctively looked for a
vision of the Wild Hunter, but a moment
later realized that the sound I heard was but
the warning cry of a whistling marmot.
Again the silence was broken, this time by a
low rumbling sound which increased in volume
until it roared like a broadside from an old
forty-four-gun man-of-war, each crag and
peak taking up the sound and hurling it
against its neighbor, until the reverberating
noise seemed to come from all points of the
compass.</p>

<p>Away in the distance I could see a white
stream pouring from the precipitous edge of
an elevated glacier; this seeming mountain
torrent I knew was not water, but ice, thousands
of tons of which having cracked and
broken from the edge of the glacier, were now
being dashed over the hard face of the rock
into minute fragments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>The white stream could be seen to decrease
perceptibly in size, from a broad sheet to a
wide band, a narrow ribbon, a line, a hair and
then disappear altogether. While the distant
mountains were still growling, mumbling and
playing shuttlecock with the echoes a timid
chief hare went hopping across a green half-acre
of grass at the damp edge of a melting
snow patch in my path. Overhead a golden
eagle sailed with a small mammal in its talons;
strange reddish-colored bumblebees busied
themselves in a bunch of flowers growing in
a crevice in the rocks at my feet.</p>

<p>But my eye could discern no larger creatures
in this Alpine pasture land; not only could I
see no sheep or goats, but not a sign of my
friend. He had vanished from the face of
the picture as completely as if the master
artist had erased him with one mighty sweep
of his paint brush.</p>

<p>When I viewed the lonely landscape with
no human being in sight, I confess to experiencing
a creepy sensation and a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
inclination to flee, but I knew not in what
direction to run. I was in a rough basin-shaped
depression among the mountain peaks,
and I sat on a large rock with my back to a
black chasm. From my elevated position I
could see a long distance. Strange fancies
creep into one&#8217;s head on such occasions and
play havoc with previous well-founded beliefs.
To me, poor fool of a tenderfoot, Big Pete
had melted into the thinnest of thin air, such
as is only found in high altitudes, and somehow
I wondered whether the Wild Hunter
had had anything to do with it.</p>

<p>How could I tell that I myself was not
invisible?</p>

<p>I hauled myself up short there for I realized
that such folly was not good to have tumbling
around in my brain. I figuratively pulled
myself back to earth, and to steady my
nerves reached into my pack and brought
out several hard bits of bannock that I had
stored there. I was dreadfully hungry and
I munched these with enthusiasm, meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
keeping a sharp eye out for Big Pete, and
between times making the acquaintance of
the little chief hare who, as he scuttled about
among the rocks, looked me over curiously.</p>

<p>A short distance to my left was a huge
obsidian cliff, the glassy walls of which rose
in a precipice to a considerable height. On
account of its peculiar formation, this crag of
natural glass had several times attracted my
attention, and on any other occasion I would
have been curious enough to give it closer
inspection. Once, as I turned my head in
that direction, I thought I heard a wild laugh
and later concluded that it was only imagination
on my part, but now, as I again faced the
cliff, I unmistakably heard a shout and was
considerably relieved to see silhouetted against
the sky the figure of Big Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Le-loo,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Through
chasin&#8217; that &#8217;ere spook Indian kid be you?
It&#8217;s about time. Gosh-all-hemlocks! I been
breakin&#8217; my neck tryin&#8217; to keep up with you,
doggone yore hide,&#8221; shouted the big guide as
he started to climb down toward me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>&#8220;Hello, Pete! You bet I&#8217;m through and
I&#8217;m blamed near all in. Where are we, do
you know?&#8221; I called to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Top o&#8217; the world, my boy. Top o&#8217; the
world, that&#8217;s whar we be,&#8221; he said with a grin.</p>

<p>I had seen no game since I had lost the
bighorn, and the sunball was now hung low in
the heavens. It appeared to me that there
was every prospect for a supperless night, too.
But Big Pete evidently had no such idea, and
he &#8220;&#8217;lowed&#8221; that he would &#8220;mosey&#8221; &#8217;round
a bit and kill some varmints for grub.</p>

<p>There seemed to be plenty of mountain
lion signs, and I was surprised that they
should frequent such high altitudes, but
Pete told me that they were up here after
marmots, and were all sleek and fat on that
diet. I would not have been surprised if my
wild comrade had proposed a feast on these
cats. But it was not long before Pete&#8217;s
revolvers could be heard barking and in a
short time he returned with two braces of
white ptarmigan, each with its head shattered
by a pistol ball, and I confess these birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
were more to my liking than cat meat. Up
there &#8217;mid the snow fields the ptarmigan
apparently kept their winter plumage all year
round, and their natural camouflage made
them utterly invisible to me, but to Pete, a
white ptarmigan on a white snowfield seemed
to be as easy to detect as if the same bird had
been perched on a heap of coal. I had not
seen one of these grouse since we had been
in the mountains and was not aware of their
presence until my companion returned with
the four dead birds.</p>

<p>Without wasting time, Pete began to prepare
them for cooking. He soon built a fire
of some sticks which he gleaned from one or
two twisted and gnarled evergreens that had
wandered above timber line and cooked the
birds over the embers. He gave a brace to
me, and sitting on a boulder with our feet
hanging over the edge we ate our evening
meal without salt or pepper, and then each of
us curled up like a grey wolf under the shelter
of a stone and slept as safely as if we were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
our bed rolls down in the genial atmosphere
of the park in place of being in the bitingly
cold air of the bleak mountain tops.</p>

<p>I, at least, slept soundly, and, thanks to
the clothes Pete had so kindly made for me,
I do not remember feeling cold. When I
awoke again it was daylight and I could
scarcely believe that I had been asleep more
than five minutes since my friend bade me
good-night. Big Pete was up before me, of
course, and when I opened my eyes I found
him cooking breakfast and making tea in a
tin cup over those economical fires he so
loved to build even when we were in the park
where there was fuel enough for a roaring
bonfire. It&#8217;s queer how difficult it is to make
water boil on a mountain top.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now fer the witch-b&#8217;ar track agin,&#8221;
said Big Pete, wiping his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Witch-bear!&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;you
don&#8217;t mean to tell me you kept following
the track of that two-legged bear this far,
Pete?&#8221; I exclaimed, suddenly recalling that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
had started out following a mysterious moccasin
trail that had later turned into bear tracks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sartin&#8217; sure. Didn&#8217;t you figger out that
that tha&#8217; b&#8217;ar war the Injun or tha&#8217; Wild
Hunter who put on moccasins made o&#8217; b&#8217;ar
feet when he thought we&#8217;d foller him?&#8221;
asked Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did, but I forgot&mdash;maybe that ram
was the Wild Hunter himself&mdash;blame it.
Nothing will astonish me in this country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you fergot everything, even yore
head when you started to foller that tha&#8217;
ram yesterday. But I didn&#8217;t. I jest kept
peggin&#8217; away at them tha&#8217; rumswattel b&#8217;ar
tracks and I followed &#8217;em right up to yonder
cliff. They go on from tha&#8217;, but I left &#8217;em
last night to come over by you. Come on,
we&#8217;ll pick &#8217;em up agin.&#8221; And off he started.</p>

<p>It was soon evident that it was an exceedingly
active bear which we were following for
it could climb over green glacier ice like a
Swiss guide and over rocks like a goat. It led
us a wild, wild chase over crevasses, friable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and treacherous stones covered with &#8220;verglass,&#8221;
over dangerous couloirs and all the other
things talked of in the Alps but forgotten in
the Rockies, to high elevations, where frozen
snow combed over the beetling crags, and
the avalanches roared and thundered down
the rocks, dashing the fragments of stone over
the lower ice fields. We were not roped
together like mountain climbers in the Swiss
or Tyrolean Alps; we got the real thrills by
using our own hands and feet without ice pick,
staff or hobnailed shoes.</p>

<p>But Big Pete never hesitated and I followed
him without a word, and when the trail led
along the edge of a dizzy height I could look
at the middle of Big Pete&#8217;s broad back and
then my head would not swim. It required
quick and good judgment to tell just how
much of a slant made a loose stone unsafe to
step upon. It was exciting and exhilarating
work, and the violent exercise kept me so
warm that I carried most of my clothes in a
bundle on my back. Presently our path led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
us into a goat trail, one of those century old
paths made by shaggy white Alpine animals,
and used by them as regular highways.
There were plenty of fresh goat signs, and the
broad path led us over a saddle mountain
to the verge of a cliff, beyond which it seemed
impossible for anything but birds to pursue
the trail. Here we sat down to rest and to
make a cup of tea over a tiny fire, although
wood was plentiful at this place, it being in the
timber line.</p>

<p>Below us lay a valley, into which numerous
small glaciers emptied their everlasting supply
of ice and blocks of stone, and horse-tail falls
poured from the melting snow fields. It might
have presented enchanting prospects to an
iceman or a bighorn, or a Rocky Mountain
goat, but for two tired men it was a gloomy,
dangerous and desolate place and I felt
certain that even a witch-bear would not
choose such a dangerous place as a camping
ground. We had finished our tea and I was
feeling somewhat refreshed when I noticed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
peculiar stinging sensation about my face; I
felt as if I had been attacked by some peculiar
form of insect. But there were none in sight.</p>

<p>Pete, at this time, was some distance away
prospecting the &#8220;lay of the land.&#8221; I saw
him suddenly pull the cape of his wamus over
his face, and reasoned that he also had been
attacked by these invisible insects.</p>

<p>To my surprise, the big fellow seemed very
much alarmed, and every time I shouted to
him it greatly excited him. As he was
hurrying to me as rapidly as possible, I
desisted from further inquiry. When Big
Pete reached my side he pulled a handkerchief
from around my neck and put it over my
mouth, making signs which I did not comprehend.
At last he put his muffled mouth
to my ear and shouted through the cape of
his wamus. &#8220;Shut yer meat-trap or you&#8217;re
food for the coyotes. It is the WHITE
DEATH!&#8221;</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p>Clothes and stage trappings can neither
add nor detract from our respect for death.
He is the same grim old gentleman, be his
mouldy bones naked, or clothed in robes of
the most gaudy or brilliant hues. A blue
death, a red death or a yellow death is just as
grizzly and awe-inspiring as one of any shade
of gray. Even a black death excites no
emotions not touched by the first name, for
it is the dread messenger himself whom we
respect and not his fanciful robes of office.</p>

<p>As far as I am personally concerned, I
confess that Big Pete&#8217;s painful suggestion
about the coyotes had more to do with keeping
my mouth shut than any terror inspired by
the lily-like purity of the garments of the
white death; what made my bones ache was
the thought of the wolves gnawing them.</p>

<p>Overhead the sun shone with an unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
brilliancy, and the atmosphere had that peculiar
crystalline transparency which kills space
and brings distant objects close to one&#8217;s feet.
Where then was the terrible white messenger?
Why must my head be muffled like a mummy?
Why must I keep my mouth shut, while the
curiosity mill within me was working overtime
grinding out questions I should dearly love
to ask?</p>

<p>Again and again I looked around me to see
where this ghostly white terror might lurk,
and now, as I gazed at the mountains, I was
surprised and annoyed to discover that the
distant peaks were gradually disappearing,
being blotted out of the landscape before my
eyes; a ghost-like mantle was creeping over
and enshrouding the mountains.</p>

<p>Like Big Pete, the witch-bear, the ptarmigan
and the stinging insects, the mountains themselves
had joined in the weird game and were
donning their fernseed caps of invisibility.
Now the air around and about me seemed to
be filled with powdered dust of mica that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
glinted, sparkled and scintillated in the sunshine.
The breeze which was tossing about
the bright atoms loosened the handkerchief
which swathed my nose and mouth, and I
was seized with a violent fit of coughing.</p>

<p>It was no gentle hand which Big Pete laid
on my shoulder before he again bound the
handkerchief around my face and motioned
for me to follow him.</p>

<p>Evidently my guide had been making good
use of his time while I was engaged in idle
speculation, for he led me to a point about
fifty yards from the goat trail where there was
a possible place to descend the cliff to a ledge
fifty feet below. By this time I had become
enough of a mountaineer to follow my guide
over trails which a few weeks previous would
have seemed to me impossible to traverse,
and after a hasty and daring descent we
reached the ledge, where I discovered the
black mouth of a cavern; into this hole Pete
thrust me and led me back some twenty yards
into the darkness, ordered me to disrobe to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the waist, then he began a most vigorous
and irritating slapping and rubbing of my
chest; so insistent and persevering was he
that I really thought my skin would be peeled
from shoulders to waist. At last he desisted
and ordered me to put on all my clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you mad, Pete? Has the rarefied air
of the mountains upset your brain? If not,
will you kindly tell me what on earth all this
means and why we are hiding in this gloomy
hole?&#8221; I asked as soon as I got the breath
back in my body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Le-loo, you be a baby, and need a keeper
to prevent you from committing susancide
several times a day. Tenderfoot? Well, I
should say so. No one but a short-horn from
the East would keep his mouth open gulping
in the frozen fog, filling his warm lungs with
quarts of fine ice. I reckon it would be
healthier to breathe pounded glass, fur it
hain&#8217;t sharper nor half as cold. Why, Le-loo,
tha&#8217; be a dose of fever and lung inflammation
in every mouthful of this frozen fog.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>He held my face between his two strong
hands so that the faint light that filtered
through the murky darkness from the cavern&#8217;s
mouth dimly illuminated my countenance,
and as he watched the streams of perspiration
falling in drops from the end of my nose his
frown relaxed and a broad grin spread over
his handsome features.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right this time,&#8221; he added
&#8220;I calculate that I&#8217;ve melted all the ice in
your bellows, so just creep up tha&#8217; and sweat
a bit more to make it slick and sartin that
we&#8217;ve beat the White Death this trip.&#8221;
I did as he said, not because I wanted to
sweat but because habit made me obey the
commands of my guide.</p>

<p>Evidently this cavern had been in constant
use by some sort of animals as a sort of stable
for many, many years, and I have had sweeter
couches, but by this time my rough life had
transformed me into something of a wild
animal myself, and it was not long before I
was comfortably dozing. During the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
that I slept I was dimly conscious of being
surrounded by a crowd of people; as the
absurdity of this forced itself through my
sleep-befuddled brain and I opened wide my
eyes, what I saw made me open my eyes
still wider.</p>

<p>I was about to start to my feet when I felt
Big Pete&#8217;s restraining hand on my shoulder,
and not until then did I realize that the cave
was crowded with the shaggy white Rocky
Mountain goats, and not weird, white-bearded
old men. Few persons can truly say that
they have been within arm&#8217;s length of a flock
of these timid and almost unapproachable
animals; but we had invaded their secret
place of refuge, and they had not, as yet,
taken alarm at our presence in their castle.
It may be that the frozen fog had driven
the goats to the cavern for shelter, and it is
possible that never having been hunted by
man, these animals feared the White Death
more than they did human beings, and did
not realize the dangerous character of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
present visitors; whatever the cause of their
temerity, the fact remains that men and
goats slept that night in the cavern together.</p>

<p>I did not awake next morning until after
the departure of the goats and opened my
eyes to find myself alone in the cavern.</p>

<p>Having all my clothes on, no time was
wasted at my toilet, but I made my way
directly to the doorway and was gratified to
discover that Big Pete was roasting some kid
chops over the hot embers of a fire.</p>

<p>After breakfasting on the remains of the
kid, Big Pete arose and scanned the sky, the
horizon and the mountain tops, and turning
to me said, &#8220;Now, Le-loo, that Wild Hunter-b&#8217;ar-wolf
man has fooled us by doubling on
his trail an&#8217; as it hain&#8217;t him we&#8217;re after now
but the trail out of the mountains, I mean to
go by sens-see-ation, but you must keep yer
meat-trap shut and not speak, &#8217;cause soon
as I know I&#8217;m a man I hain&#8217;t got no more
sense than a man. I must say to myself,
&#8216;Now, Pete, you&#8217;re a varmint and varmints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
know their way even in a new country.&#8217;
Then I just sense things and trots along &#8217;til
I come out all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had often heard of this wonderful instinct
of direction, the homing instinct of the
pigeon, which some Indians, Africans, Australian
black boys and a few white men still
possess; I say still possess because it is evident
that it was once our common heritage, a sort of
sixth sense which has been lost by disuse.
That Big Pete possessed this sixth sense I
little doubted, and it was with absorbing interest
that I watched the man work himself into
the proper state of mind.</p>

<p>For quite a time he stood sniffing the air
and looking around him while his body swayed
with a slow motion. Then suddenly, as if
he had seen something or as if answering the
call of something, he started off almost at
right angles to our trail, acting very much like
a hound on an old scent, but keeping up a
pace that tried my endurance.</p>

<p>It was truly wonderful the way this man, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
a trance-like state, was guided by an invisible
power over the most dangerous ground, but
no one, after a careful survey, could have
selected a better trail than that chosen by
Big Pete. On and on we went, scrambling
over rock-skirting precipices and crumbling
ledges. A dense fog settled around us, making
each step hazardous, but with an instinct as
true and apparently identical with that of
our four-footed brothers, my guide kept the
same rapid pace for hours, and then, all of a
sudden, came to an abrupt stop.</p>

<p>For several seconds he stood in his tracks,
his body keeping the same swaying motion,
but after a short while he crept cautiously
forward in the fog, with me at his heels, and
we found ourselves at the edge of a giant
fault, similar to the one in Darlinkel Park,
but there was apparently no pass to let us
down the towering precipices to the valley
below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that was a wonderful trip,&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; shouted Pete savagely, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
I had spoken and the spell was broken;
reason, not instinct, must now lead us.</p>

<p>Vapor and clouds concealed the low grounds
from our view; however, we were determined
not to spend another night in the mountains,
so while I rested and regained my breath,
Big Pete went on to explore the ledges.</p>

<p>Presently my guide hove in sight and
motioned me to follow him; he led me to a
place where another goat trail went over the
edge of the precipice, this time not in ten and
fifteen feet jumps, but by a steep diagonal
path. Down the treacherous trail we slipped
and slid with a wall of rocks on one side and
death in the form of a bluish white space on
the other side.</p>

<p>As we were clambering carefully around
the face of a big rock Pete suddenly whispered
that he smelt a &#8220;Painter,&#8221; and upon peering
around the corner we found ourselves face to
face with a large cat; the animal was crouching
upon a flat-topped projecting stone immediately
in our path. That it was not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
puma of the low-lands, its reddish-colored
coat and great size proclaimed. It was a
so-called mountain lion and a grand specimen
of its kind.</p>

<p>The cat&#8217;s small head lay between its muscular
forepaws, its hair adhered closely to its
body, its long tail was full and round and
waved slowly from side to side, while its eyes
gleamed like electric sparks.</p>

<p>We were in a most awkward position; our
guns were swung by straps over our backs,
so that we might use our hands, and we were
clinging to the face of the big rock while our
toes were seeking foothold in the treacherous
shale of the trail. To loosen our hands was to
fall backwards into the bluish white sea of
unknown depths, and to retrace our steps
was out of the question.</p>

<p>Pete often expressed the opinion that no
predaceous creature, from a spider up to a
cougar, will attack its prey while the latter is
immovable.</p>

<p>As a corollary to this proposition he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
that when a person is suddenly confronted
by a dangerous wild beast, the safest plan to
pursue is to remain perfectly quiet, or, as he
quaintly put it, &#8220;to peetrify yourself in the
wink of an eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Truth to tell, on this occasion I found no
difficulty in following his directions. I was
&#8220;peetrified&#8221; by fear; my feet were cold and
numb, chills in wavelets washed up and down
my spine, a sudden rash seemed to be breaking
out all over my body and the skin on my back
felt as if it had been converted into goose-flesh.</p>

<p>Had we been able to travel a few feet
further we would have both found a comparatively
safe footing and had our arms
free and a fighting chance with the big
catamount in place of hanging suspended to
the face of the rock like two big, helpless,
terrified bats.</p>

<p>With an imperceptible movement, as steady
and almost as slow as that of a glacier, my
guide twisted his neck until his face was
turned from the puma and the side of the
mouth pressed against the flat surface of his
rock. I was crowded up against Big Pete,
who occupied a position but slightly in advance
and a little above me. My agony of fear
having somewhat subsided I ventured to steal
a momentary glance at my comrade&#8217;s face.
To my unutterable surprise I discovered a
whimsical twinkling at the corners of his eyes
and a mirthful expression of mischief in his
countenance. This was incomprehensible to
me, for I could imagine no more awe-inspiring
position than the one we then occupied.</p>

<p>While my thoughts were still busy trying
to fathom the cause of Pete&#8217;s untimely
mirth, the long-drawn howl of the big timber
wolf floated over the valley and sent a new lot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of shivers down my back. It was the rallying
call used by the wolves to call the band together
when game is in sight. The sound
increased in volume until it reverberated
among the crags like the voice of a winter&#8217;s
storm, and then it gradually died away.
Big Pete was not only a good mimic but he
proved himself to be a ventriloquist of no
mean ability; by the help of the rock against
which his cheek was pressed he had been able
to throw his voice off into space in such a
manner that it baffled me for several moments.</p>

<p>The gray wolves are old and inveterate
enemies of the panther or cougar, hunting
the cats on all occasions. Consequently all
panthers know the meaning of that wild
lonesome howl, the assembling call, as well
as the oldest wolf in the pack, and its effect
upon the lion in our path was instantaneous.
The hair, which had a moment before been as
slick as if it were oiled, now rose upright until
the fuzzy hide gave the animal&#8217;s body the
appearance of being twice its original size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>Scarcely had the big cat vacated the path
before we scrambled to the firm foothold and
I breathed a great sigh of relief when it was
reached. But Big Pete was convulsed with
suppressed laughter at the practical joke he
had played on the mountain lion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gosh darn my magnolia breath! That
painter went as if he had a ball of hot rorrum
tied to his tail,&#8221; cried my guide.</p>

<p>It was difficult for me to realize that it was
Big Pete himself who had given vent to that
shuddering howl, and now the danger was over
I pleaded with him to give another exhibition
of his skill in wolf calls.</p>

<p>The good-natured fellow at first seemed
reluctant to repeat his performance, but at
length consented and put his hands to his
mouth, forming a trumpet, then bent forward
his body, stooping so low that his face was
was below his waist, after which he began again
that wild cry which so closely resembles in
sentiment and tone the shriek of the wind.
As the sound increased in volume the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
waved his head from side to side; continuing
the movement he gradually assumed an
upright pose, and ended by making a low
obeisance as the sound died away.</p>

<p>The imitation was perfect and I was expressing
my delight and appreciation when my ear
caught a distant sound which put a sudden
stop to our conversation.</p>

<p>Was it the wind which I now heard? No!
there was not a breath of air stirring, neither
was it an echo. There could be no doubt
about it, the long-drawn sepulchral howl
which filled and permeated the shivering air
was an answering cry to Big Pete&#8217;s call.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the sound waves faded away
when in the mysterious distance came another
and another answer, until it seemed as if a
troop of lost souls were vocalizing their
misery. I unslung my gun and loosened my
revolvers in their fringed holsters, but Big Pete
only shrugged his shoulders and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let&#8217;s be moseying. &#8217;Taint nothin&#8217;
but wolves.&#8221; A fact of which I was as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
aware of as Pete, but I, tenderfoot that I was,
could not treat howling of wolves with the
same unconcern as did my guide.</p>

<p>We soon reached a point where the goat
trail turned again up the mountain and we
forsook that ancient path for a diagonal
fracture very similar to the one by which we
had ascended, which led down the face of the
precipice &#8220;slantendicularwise,&#8221; Big Pete said,
and soon plunged into the bluish gray sea
which filled the valley. We were now enveloped
in a dense fog, which added materially
to the dangers of the journey. I had had so
many thrills in the last few moments that my
nerves were becoming dull and failed to vibrate
on this occasion, so that descending the cliff
in a fog by a diagonal fracture in the rock
became only an incident of our journey; this
trail, however, was wider than the one by
which we ascended.</p>

<p>The Rocky Mountains are full of new
sensations and I got a new one when I
discovered that the fog through which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
we had been traveling was in reality a cloud,
and, all unexpectedly, we emerged into the
clear mellow light below the floating vapor.
It was an enchanting scene which met our
eyes; below us stretched a beautiful valley.</p>

<p>For the first time in months I saw a human
habitation. The blue smoke from the chimney
ascended slowly in a tall column and then
floated horizontally in stratified layers. There
were fields of ripe grain, orchards, groves,
pasture lands and a winding stream fringed
with poplars, which flowed in a tortuous
course across the valley. As I feasted my eyes
on the peaceful scene a great longing took
possession of my soul.</p>

<p>Big Pete, too, was lost in thought, conjured
up by the scene below us. He stood leaning
on his rifle with his eyes fixed on the enchanting
picture; so full of unconscious dignity
was his pose, so immovable stood the mountain
man that he looked like a grand statue
done by a master hand.</p>

<p>But what thoughts were conjured up in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
guide&#8217;s brain by the unexpected sight of
this ranch could not be interpreted from the
expression of his countenance, for that showed
no more trace of emotion than an American
Indian at the torture stake, or the marble
face of a Greek god. Presently he shifted
his pose, threw back his head, and Big Pete&#8217;s
eyes were fixed on the valley in front of us, as
with distended nostrils he sniffed the mountain
air, his brows contracted to a frown, his
eyes lost their gentle angelic look and seemed
to change from China blue to a cold steel
color, and his tightly closed mouth had a
stern expression about the corners which
appeared altogether out of keeping with the
occasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rot my hide!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;if I hain&#8217;t
had a neighbor all these years and never
knowed it. Waugh! Some emigrant&mdash;terrification
seize him!&mdash;has found another park
an&#8217; squatted, t&#8217;ain&#8217;t more&#8217;n eight miles as a
crow flies from mine, nuther, Le-loo.&#8221; He
looked at the sun and muttered. &#8220;Hang me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
but &#8217;tis t&#8217;other end of my own park,&#8221; then
he paused a moment and added fiercely,
&#8220;if these geysers know when they are well off,
they&#8217;ll steer shy of Darlinkel Park. If I
catch &#8217;em scoutin&#8217; &#8217;round my claim, I&#8217;ll send
&#8217;em a-hoppin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless me, you are neighborly,&#8221; exclaimed a
voice in smooth, even tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; said Pete, looking sternly at me.
&#8220;Did you speak?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said nothing,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>Big Pete&#8217;s countenance changed and he ran
his hands over the cartridges in his belt in
the old familiar manner, and with a motion
quicker than I can describe it, whipped out
his revolvers and wheeled about face, at the
same time snapping out the words, &#8220;Throw up
your hands!&#8221;</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p>We were standing on the surface of a flat
table-rock, which jutted out from the face
of the towering cliff and overhung the valley
that was spread out like a map beneath us.
About twenty feet back from the edge of the
rock was a pile of debris heaped up against
the face of the cliff; but the remaining surface
of the stone was clean bare and weather-beaten.
The talus against the cliff was
composed of loose fragments of stone and
other products of wash and erosion. This
was overgrown with a thicket of stunted
shrubs, wry-necked goblin thistles and murderous
devil&#8217;s clubs. These bludgeon-shaped
plants, thickly covered with sharp thorns,
reared aloft their weapons as if in menace to
all living things; the unstable ground and
thorny thicket formed the only shelter where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
we could be ambushed in the rear, and it was
not a likely spot to be chosen for such a
purpose by man or beast.</p>

<p>When Big Pete wheeled about face with his
trusty revolvers in hand, I quickly followed
his example, and our mutual surprise may be
imagined when we found ourselves gazing in
the faces of a semicircle of gigantic wolves.
The animals were squatting on their haunches
at the foot of the talus, their wicked slant
eyes fixed upon us and their red tongues
lolling out from their cavernous mouths.</p>

<p>I cannot tell why, whether it was the state of
my nerves or the effect of the rare air of the
high altitude, or what, but I felt no fear at
facing this strange wolf pack. Indeed, to me
they appeared all to be laughing and their
red tongues lolled from their open mouths in
a very humorous fashion.</p>

<p>The whole scene appeared to me to be
exceedingly funny and, in a spirit of utter
reckless bravado, I doffed my fur cap, with
exaggerated politeness made a low bow, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
addressing the largest and most devilish-looking
wolf in the pack, exclaimed,</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! this is Monsieur Loup-Garou, I
believe. Pardon me, Monsieur, but did you
speak a moment since?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Big Pete Darlinkel looked at the wolves,
and great beads of sweat stood on his forehead.
It was his turn to have the shivers. There
was no more color in his face than in a peeled
turnip. His gun shook in his left hand like a
aspen, while the spangled gun in his right
hand dropped its muzzle towards earth and
there was scarcely strength enough in his
nerveless fingers to have pulled a hair-trigger.</p>

<p>Pete&#8217;s great baby-blue eyes turned helplessly
to me; but it was now my innings, and
with a cheery voice I cried,</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Pete, old fellow, what ails you?&#8221;
Then meanly quoting his own words, I added,
&#8220;They hain&#8217;t nothing but wolves!&#8221;</p>

<p>There is not a shadow of a doubt that Pete
expected the wolves to answer me with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
human voice, and I am willing to confess that,
even to me, there seemed to be no other
alternative for the slant-eyed bandits to
pursue. But for the present they appeared
to prefer to maintain a solemn silence.</p>

<p>The middle wolf had been looking intently
at us for some time before a well-modulated
voice said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I have answered your call, gentlemen;
how can I serve you?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was more than half expecting some such
answer, but if it had not been so evident that
Big Pete was badly frightened and had lost
all his self-possession, I should have thought
he was again practising his art as ventriloquist.</p>

<p>Of course I deceived myself. The wolves
had no more power of speech than a house-dog.
But I really thought the wolves were doing
the talking until I caught sight of a tall man
of handsome and distinguished appearance
seated among the weird goblin-thistles just
above the wolves. The stranger appeared
to be a man of almost any age; he might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
young but, if old, he was wonderfully well
preserved. He was clad in a light-colored
buckskin suit of clothes, edged and trimmed
with fur, a fur cap on his head and moccasins
on his feet. And I noticed, with a start, that
he had that same red porcupine quill ornament
on his hunting shirt that the young Indian wore.</p>

<p>When I saw how his dress blended perfectly
with his surroundings I excused myself for
not sooner detecting him. I could not help
but admire his easy grace and the sense of
reserved strength in his strong figure. The
calmness and repose forcibly reminded me of
the mountain lion we had lately encountered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You kin hackle me and card my sinews,
if it hain&#8217;t the Wild Hunter himself an&#8217; his
pack,&#8221; said Big Pete under his breath.</p>

<p>The color now began to return to his face
and at the recollection of his late rude words
the big fellow blushed like a school girl.
Gradually he recovered his self-possession,
and, doffing his cap, made a low bow as graceful
and as courtly as that of any polished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
courtier. This was an entirely new side to
my friend&#8217;s character and I listened with
interest when he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, whether you be loup-garou, werwolf,
witch-b&#8217;ar or all them to onct, I do not care.
What I want ter say is ef that tha&#8217; ranch
yander be your&#8217;n, you may hamstring me ef
I hain&#8217;t proud to have such a man for a neighbor.
Whatever else you be yore no shavetail
or shorthorn, an&#8217; that&#8217;s howsomever. I don&#8217;t
mind sayin&#8217; that yore a better shot an&#8217; all
around hunter an&#8217; mountain man than Daniel
Boone, Simon Kenton, Davy Crockett, Kit
Carson, Bison McClean and Jim Baker all
rolled in one. Yore the slickest woodsman
on the divide. I&#8217;m powerful proud of you as
a neighbor and would be still prouder ef I
might call you my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our strange visitor displayed a beautiful
white set of teeth as a frank smile played
over his smooth face. But his only answer
at that moment was an inclination of his
head and a muttered command to the wolves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
which they instantly obeyed by silently
disappearing in the underbrush.</p>

<p>After a pause the tall stranger came forward,
and, removing his own cap, made a bow even
more courtly than that of Big Pete, as he thus
replied: &#8220;Sir, I feel highly honored at this
flattering expression of commendation. I can
honestly say that it is the greatest compliment
I have ever received from a stranger, and,&#8221; he
added with another winning smile,
&#8220;you are the first stranger with whom I have
held converse in nearly twenty years. That
I am not unfriendly I have already proved by
some trifling services, but the honor of the
acquaintance is mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the formalities of our meeting were
over the stranger stood for a few moments with
his chin resting on his breast. He was evidently
thinking over some serious subject.
His head was bare, his fur cap being in his
hands, and his hands locked behind his back.
A mass of light colored hair fell over his
forehead and shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>Presently he looked at us again, with that
same grave smile on his face, and said that
if we would consent to be blindfolded and
trust ourselves implicitly to his care, he would
be glad to take us to his home and would feel
honored if we should choose to visit him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can proceed no further on this trail
for it ends here, and not even a goat can go
beyond the rock on which we stand, therefore
we must retrace our steps a few hundred
yards,&#8221; he explained, as he apologized for his
strange proposition. He securely bandaged
our eyes with our own handkerchiefs, and
after turning us around until I at least had
lost all sense of direction, he placed thongs in
our hands, and then we discovered that we
were to be led by some sort of animals, presumably
wolves. Whatever else they were,
they proved to be careful and sagacious
leaders.</p>

<p>After a short distance of rough climbing
where we constantly needed the personal help
of our mysterious host, we began to descend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and soon our feet told us that we were traveling
on a comparatively smooth though steep trail.
Now and again our guide would speak to warn
us of stones or other obstructions in our path,
but, with the exception of these necessary
words of caution and brief words expressing
approval or reproof to the animals, we made
the journey in silence and in due time reached
the bottom, and our feet told us that we were
walking on a level shale-covered path.</p>

<p>At this point the creatures leading us were
dismissed and we could hear them scrambling
back over the trail. We heard the bleating
of sheep, the lowing of cattle and all the
multiplicity of noises so familiar on a well-stocked
farm, and we could easily detect the
different odors as familiar and characteristic
as the noises. We enjoyed to its fullest
extent the novelty of the homely sensations
aroused by the smell of new-mown hay and
the familiar medley of sounds peculiar to the
farm.</p>

<p>In due time we found ourselves at the foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of a couple of wooden steps, which we ascended,
and, crossing a broad veranda, entered
a doorway. Here we stood awaiting further
commands in utter ignorance of our surroundings.
Of course, we surmised we were in the
ranch house which we saw from the table rock,
but this was only a surmise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said the strange old man,
&#8220;you are welcome to my home, and allow me
to add that you are the only white men who
have ever crossed the threshold of this house.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking he removed the
bandages from our eyes.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p>It was a strange place, indeed, in which
I found myself. Our eyes were unbandaged
after we entered the portal of the ranch house,
and when Big Pete and I turned toward our
guide, we were facing in a direction that gave
us a sweeping view of the entire ranch. And
what we saw made us marvel.</p>

<p>This farm, between the towering, almost
insurmountable mountains, had evidently
been wrenched from what two decades before
had been as much of a wilderness as the Darlinkel
Park across the divide. Timber clothed
the mountains on either hand but the fertile
valley bottom was as rural as a district of the
middle west. On one hand stretched acres
and acres of ripened grain. Beyond was
pasture land dotted with strange whitefaced
animals, which later proved to be hybrid
buffalos, a strange cross between wild and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
domestic cattle.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In other pastures and on
the hillsides I could see goats and sheep, and
these too were evidently a cross breed of wild
and domestic stock, the goats having a very
strange resemblance to the fleet-footed shaggy
old fellows we had seen on the mountains,
while the sheep closely resembled usual domestic
sheep.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Since that time the late Buffalo Jones has bred buffalo and
domestic cattle and called the offspring &#8220;catelow.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>There were stables, too, and corrals, all
made of logs, as was the ranch house, but what
seemed very strange to me was the fact that
there were no horses in sight. All of the animals
at work in the fields were those strange
hybrid buffalo-oxen, all save one, a single,
lame and apparently almost blind burro that
I saw lying in the sun. From his grayness
about the head I had little doubt that he was
of great age.</p>

<p>There were hordes of strange poultry too,&mdash;strange
to me at least, for never had I expected
to find flocking together wild turkeys, Canadian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
geese, black ducks, wood ducks, and
mallards (all with wings clipped so that they
never again could fly), sage hens, quail,
spruce-grouse, partridge, ptarmigan and western
mountain quail. All seemed perfectly
at home and comfortably domesticated.</p>

<p>Beyond the poultry houses was still another
outhouse, a long, low, log building before
which was a lawn. On the lawn were all
manner of perches and roosts and on these,
sunning themselves and preening their feathers,
were several types of predaceous birds,
ranging from huge and powerful female eagles
to smaller hawks and true falcons. This
evidently was the Wild Hunter&#8217;s falconry.</p>

<p>Another thing that made an instant impression
upon me was the number of men
at work about the place. The workmen were
all, without an exception, Indians, and as they
moved about silently, their stoic, almost
expressionless faces held a decided look of
contentment, a few of them turned toward the
porch with a frank, honest stare. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
no evidence of fear or restraint in their actions
but they always gave the wolf dogs plenty
of room as they passed them. These black
beasts were ugly, snarling things that showed
no love for anyone; on the least provocation
menacing growls rumbled in their throats.</p>

<p>What manner of place was this that we had
permitted ourselves to be led into? Indeed,
what manner of man was this strange host of
ours? I shot a sidelong glance at him and it
seemed to me as if I caught a strange, hunted
look in his eyes, and a sad smile on his handsome
but grim countenance. A slight feeling
of fear crept into my heart. Could this
strange man be my father? For some reason
he certainly did attract me and excite my
sympathy, yet I stood in awe of him. The
strangeness of my surroundings, too, settled
upon me. I turned toward Pete and I had a
premonition of evil. I could see that he too
was affected the same way. The valley was
an earthly paradise, the Wild Hunter a kindly
gentleman, what then was it that gave me an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
uncomfortable and uneasy feeling? I was
eager to be alone with Pete for I knew that he
would have some interesting observations to
make.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am disappointed, gentlemen, you say
nothing. Isn&#8217;t my ranch interesting to you?&#8221;
demanded the Wild Hunter, with a smile.
In a low smooth voice he gave some orders to a
young Indian who was walking toward the
stables. The Indian instantly snapped into
action and hurried away as if one of the black
wolf dogs were snapping at his heels, and I felt
certain that it was the youth whom we had
been trailing.</p>

<p>A hurried and very unpleasant thought
flashed through my mind: What was the
source of the power the Wild Hunter held over
these Indians? They were not slaves in this
mountain-surrounded prison; this grim, forceful
but kindly wild man did not hold them
through fear. He always smiled when he
greeted them, but he never smiled at his
wolves; when giving them orders or even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
looking at them, the expression of his face
was stern and almost fierce. But the man
had asked a question. He was expecting an
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a wonderful place,&#8221; I managed to
stammer; &#8220;who could conceive of such a
remarkable ranch buried here in the heart of
the wilderness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a ring-tailed snorter, hamstring me if
it hain&#8217;t,&#8221; said Big Pete in an attempt to be
enthusiastic.</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s face glowed with pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the first white men to see it. I
think I have achieved something here in the
wilds, thanks a great deal to Pluto and his
strain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh, what?&#8221; exclaimed Big Pete in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;To&mdash;to&mdash;whom,&#8221; I gasped, for to have the
man actually confess an alliance with Satan
rather startled me also.</p>

<p>The Wild Hunter chuckled in an amused
manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks to Pluto, I said. But Pluto is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
that black wolf-dog over there, nevertheless.
I think that the name &#8216;Pluto&#8217; fits his character
to a nicety.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed to the massive, deep-chested,
long-haired, long-limbed, vicious looking leader
of his black wolf pack where it was chained to
a post. The great animal glared at his
master when his name was mentioned. He
crouched twenty feet away with his slanting
green eyes fixed constantly on his master&#8217;s
face and in them ever flared a fierce, wicked
fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you son of Satan, you and your
hybrid whelps have helped me do all this in
spite of the fact that you hate me, and would
love to tear me limb from limb. You splendid,
ugly brute, you are insensible to kindness!&#8221;</p>

<p>I noticed that whenever he looked the wolf
in the face his own countenance became grim
and his eyes exceedingly fierce and not unlike
the wolf itself in expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p><p>&#8220;He hates me,&#8221; he continued, turning to
us, &#8220;because of his ancestors. In him is the
blood of a Great Dane noted for its strength,
size and ferocity, a fierce brute which I brought
over the mountains with me many years ago.
Pluto&#8217;s mother was a pure black wolf of a
mean disposition, and his father the half-breed
son of a Great Dane and a she-wolf.
He is the fiercest and most bloodthirsty beast
in the whole pack, he hates me with the intense
hatred of his wolfish nature, he hates me because
he knows that I am the master of the
pack, the real leader, and he is jealous.
Since his puppy days he has watched for a
chance to kill me; twice he nearly succeeded&mdash;the
time will no doubt come when it will be
his life or mine. Yet because of his wonderful
strength, endurance and sagacity, I could
almost love him.</p>

<p>&#8220;His breed does not want to recognize any
master. But <i>I am</i> his master!&#8221; cried the
Wild Hunter as his eyes flashed and he struck
himself on his chest, &#8220;and he knows it. The
only way, however, that I keep my power
over him and his pack is by forcing myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
to think every time I speak to them, now I
am going to <i>kill you</i>, and brutes though they
are they can read my mind and fear me.
Besides which self-interest helps a little towards
their loyalty. With me for a leader
there is always a kill at the end of the hunt,
and they know that they come in for a share
of the food.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes I fear the wolves will break
loose and attack my Indians, which I would
very much regret, for the Redmen are faithful
fellows and we form a happy community.
The Indians look upon me as Big Medicine
because I can control these medicine wolves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Big Pete looked at the man with open
admiration, a man who by the sheer power
of his will could control a band of wolves,
any one of which was powerful enough to kill
an ox, certainly was a man to please the wild
nature of Big Pete. &#8220;But,&#8221; said Pete, &#8220;you
say Pluto has helped you. How?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;How,&#8221; exclaimed the Wild Hunter, &#8220;why,
gentlemen, by governing the pack as savage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
as himself. The pack is the secret of my
whole success; my power over them first won
the allegiance of the Indians, won their admiration
and their respect. They know that I
could turn those wolves upon them at any
moment, but they also know that I would not
think of doing such an act and they are human
and love me; the wolves are brutes and not
susceptible to kindness. The wolves hate
the Redmen as they hate me, but they supplied
us all with food, they secured for us our winter
meat while the men worked to build houses
and clear the land, and thus made it possible
for us to start this settlement. They even
acted as pack animals for us, each of them
carrying as much as seventy pounds in weight
on their backs. But be on your guard,
gentlemen, be on your guard! Remember
that you are strangers to the wolves and they
will not hesitate, if the opportunity offers, to
rend you and even devour you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later his expression changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough of this,&#8221; he exclaimed in pleasanter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
tones, &#8220;come, dinner is served,&#8221; and turning,
he led the way through the broad doorway
of the log ranch house into an almost sumptuously
furnished dining room where two
silent, soft-footed Indians began immediately
to serve a truly remarkable meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may be lo-coed,&#8221; whispered Pete to me
as we took our places at the table, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll
tell the folks, he is a master looney alright.
He knows how to make Injuns love him and
varmints fear him, he kin pack all his duffle
in my bag, he need not cough up eny money
when he&#8217;s with me. Reckon we be alright
here, but waugh! we&#8217;ve gotter watch tha&#8217;
black wolf pack!&mdash;yes and also that young
Indian whose ram you shot; it seems he looks
after the wolves and sees to it that they are
fastened up in their corral. I wouldn&#8217;t want
him to be sort of careless, you know.&#8221;</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p>What a dining room that was! All of logs,
high ceilinged, with smoked rafters stained
like an old meerschaum pipe. It reminded me
of a wealthy man&#8217;s hunting lodge in Maine,
perhaps, rather than the abode of a wild man.
There was a huge yawning fireplace at one
end, above which was the finest specimen of
an elk&#8217;s head I have ever seen. There were
other heads, too, prong-horned antelope,
beautiful bison heads, remarkable specimens
of bighorn sheep and mountain goats, there
were buffalo robes and wolf robes strewn over
the floor, and there were abundant well
stocked gun cases on every hand.</p>

<p>But conspicuous among the collection of
firearms was one, kept apart, polished and
cleaned, and on a rack made of elk horns
handily placed just above the big mantle.
It was beautifully though not elaborately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
made, with a fine damascus barrel of tremendous
length, a lock and set trigger that
showed expert handicraft, and stock of beautifully
polished birds-eye maple. An expert
would have known immediately that it was a
first-water product of an expert gunsmith.</p>

<p>Big Pete noticed it as soon as I did and he
could not keep his eyes from roving to it
occasionally during the meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may scalp me, stranger, fer sayin&#8217; it,
but I&#8217;d like mightily well to heft that tha&#8217;
shooting iron o&#8217; your&#8217;n and examine it when
we git through with chuck,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Our strange host looked up at the rifle, then
searchingly at Big Pete.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind showing it to you, but you
must not touch it,&#8221; he said finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I wouldn&#8217;t hurt it none. I&#8217;ve
handled guns before,&#8221; said Big Pete shortly,
and I could see that he was piqued at the
man&#8217;s attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess you wouldn&#8217;t, but I&#8217;ve made it a
rule never to let strange hands touch that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
rifle,&#8221; said the strange man, and there was a
grimness about his tone that forbade quibbling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh, well I can&#8217;t say as perhaps yore not
right about yore shootin&#8217; hardware at that,&#8221;
said Pete. Then after glancing at it again,
he added, &#8220;a hunter&#8217;s gun and a woodsman&#8217;s ax
should never be trusted in strange hands. Bet
a ten spot it&#8217;s a Patrick Mullen. Hain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The name of my kinsman, the famous
gunsmith, brought a sudden realization that
Mullen was my own family name.</p>

<p>The mention of the gunsmith seemed also
to have a curious effect on the old man.
His face grew red under the tan and his brow
wrinkled and I could see his cold blue eyes
scrutinizing Big Pete closely. Finally he
said bluntly,</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, and it&#8217;s worth a thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand dollars!&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;a
thousand dollars?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cried the old man almost fiercely,
&#8220;yes, yes, and it is my gun. He gave it to
me, he did&mdash;to me and not to Donald. He&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>He stood up suddenly as if he intended to
stride over and seize the gun, to protect it from
us but as quickly sat down again and buried
his face in his hands, and I could see him biting
his lips as if he were attempting to control his
feeling.</p>

<p>As for me, quite suddenly a great light
seemed to dawn. This strange old man was
mentioning names that were familiar&mdash;that
meant worlds to me. I leaned toward him
eagerly. Big Pete stood quietly listening, a
silent but interested spectator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know Donald Mullen, a brother
to the famous gunsmith? Tell me, did you
know him? I have come all the way&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I stopped in wonder. Never in all my life
do I ever expect to witness such a pitiful
expression of anguish pictured so vividly on
the human countenance as it was on the face
of the Wild Hunter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;did you know
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was my father,&#8221; I answered simply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>For a moment the Wild Hunter looked at
me intently, then said, &#8220;I believe you, you
favor him somewhat.&#8221; He then came forward
as if to shake my hand, but changed
his mind and sat down with a forced and
wan smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I know Don Mullen? Did I? He
was my partner, my bunkee for many years
and on many prospecting trips, a better
bunkee no man ever had, but he is dead now,
dead! dead! dead! been dead for a dozen years.
He was killed by an avalanche. A better
partner no man ever had,&#8221; he murmured and
relaxed into silence.</p>

<p>My efforts to get more information of my
parents were of no avail. The Wild Hunter
turned the conversation in other directions.</p>

<p>Of course, the knowledge that my real
father was dead, had been dead a long time,
caused me a feeling of sadness, yet strangely
enough the little knowledge that I had gleaned
from this strange old man brought a sense of
relief to me. I think that it must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
a certain sense of satisfaction to know that
this queer man was not my father.</p>

<p>But if he was not Donald Mullen, who was
he? That question kept me pondering and for
the rest of the meal I was silent, speculating
on this strange situation, nor did I have an
opportunity to note, as Big Pete did, the
tearful, kindly glances that the Wild Hunter
shot at me now and then.</p>

<p>Still, for all, he was sociable, extremely
sociable, and talkative, too, but I fancy now
as I recall it, he was simply keeping the conversation
in safe channels, for it was very
apparent that the rifle and his former mining
partner were painful subjects.</p>

<p>Dinner over, we all went out onto the porch
of the ranch house, where we talked while
the twilight lasted. At least Big Pete and the
Wild Hunter talked as they smoked two of
those mysterious long cigars, but I was still
silent because of the many strange thoughts
that were romping through my mind.</p>

<p>Soon darkness settled down and Big Pete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
began to yawn. I also was heavy-eyed, and
presently the Wild Hunter clapped his hands
and summoned a leather-skinned old Indian
to whom he gave brief low command in the
Mewan Indian tongue, as I was afterwards
informed by Big Pete, then turning to us he
said in his fascinating soft voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;It will probably be a novelty for both of
you gentlemen to again sleep in a bed between
sheets and under a roof. I doubt whether you
will enjoy it even though the sheets are clean
linen which were spun and woven by my noble
Indians. Moose Ear, here, will conduct you
to your rooms and I will take a turn about
the place before retiring to see that all is well,
and also to see that my black wolf pack is
securely confined within the wolf corral. This
is a precaution, gentlemen, which I take every
night, because a wolf is a wolf no matter
how well trained he may be upon the surface,
and night is the time wolves delight to run.
These beasts are especially dangerous to
strangers and it is for that reason I am putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
you in the house in place of allowing you to
camp outdoors, as I know you would prefer to
do. Good-night, gentlemen, see that the
doors are closed. Pleasant dreams.&#8221;</p>

<p>As we said good-night to him I wondered
vaguely if the wolf pen was securely built, for
it seemed to me that I detected a suggestion
of doubt in the mind of the Wild Hunter
himself. I little realized, however, the horrors
the darkness had in store for us.</p>




<h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>


<p>Moose Ear, the silent, wrinkled old Indian,
with lighted candles made of buffalo tallow,
guided Big Pete and me up the broad
skilfully built puncheon stairway to the upper
story of the surprisingly large ranch house,
where he showed us to our rooms, rooms
which were a joy to look upon. Each was
furnished with a heavy, hand-made four-posted
bedstead, which in spite of the massiveness
was beautifully made, and I wondered
at the patience of the Wild Hunter in teaching
the Indians their craftmanship.</p>

<p>The other furniture in the room was also
hand wrought, as were the fiber rugs on the
floor and the checked homespun blankets on
the beds. There was a harmonious and
pleasing effect; the rooms were cheerful,
abounding in evidences of Indian handicraft.
Beadwork and embroidery of dyed porcupine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
quills were prevalent, even the tester which
roofed the four-post bedstead was ornamented
with fringes of buckskin and designs made of
beads and porcupine quills. The chairs and
floors were plentifully supplied with fur rugs,
and the quaint, old-fashioned appearance of
the room in nowise detracted from its comfort
or even luxury.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the uncomfortable
thought of that pack of black wolves outside,
I am sure I would have been supremely happy
at the prospect of once more spending a night
between clean and cool sheets and a real
feather pillow on which to rest my head.
Eagerly and almost excitedly I threw off my
clothes and donned the long, linen nightshirt
with which old Moose Ear had provided me.
Then I put the buckhorn extinguisher over
the candle and dove into the feather bed as
gleefully as a child on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>I expected to immediately fall asleep, but
there is where I made a mistake; my mind
would not cease working, the wheels in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
head kept buzzing and would not stop. I was
as wide awake as a codfish; the bed was comfortable,
too comfortable, but tired though I
was I felt no inclination to sleep. I thought
it was the strangeness of my surroundings
which kept me tossing from side to side, but
I soon realized that the trouble was to be
found in the fact that for months I had only
had the sky for my roof, never using our tents
or open faced shack except in bad weather;
but here, the ornamented tester of the bed
and the ceiling itself seemed to be resting on
my chest; in spite of the wide open windows
the room seemed stuffy and oppressive. I felt
as if I would suffocate.</p>

<p>Twice I got up and sat by the open window
and gazed out at the black landscape. The
sky was cloudy and there were no stars; this
combined with the pine trees about the
ranch house made the darkness so black and
thick that it seemed as if one might cut it in
chunks, with a knife. The air felt good to
breathe but I did not propose to sit by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
window all night so at last I arose, put moccasins
on my feet and, taking my blankets with
me, stole stealthily down the stairs, opened
the front door and made my bed on the floor
of the broad piazza. I had not forgotten
the warning to keep indoors, but I thought I
would rather risk the wolves than to smother
all night.</p>

<p>In the darkness I discovered another occupant
of the piazza also rolled up in a blanket
taken from a bed in the house. Feeling with
my hands I discovered that it was Big Pete.
Comfortably settling myself in my blanket I
felt the breeze from the mountain blowing
over my face and through my hair, and it
soothed me until I dropped off into gentle
slumber; but during the months I had been
sleeping in the open I had learned the art, as
the saying is, of sleeping with one eye open.
In this case, however, if the eye had really
been wide open it could have seen nothing
because of the darkness, but the darkness
did not interfere with my ability to hear, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
after I had been sleeping awhile I found
myself suddenly sitting bolt upright in my
blankets with beads of perspiration on my
forehead and that terrible sensation of horror
which one experiences in a nightmare. I
knew that I had heard something, but what?</p>

<p>The oppressive silence of the wilderness
made the valley appear as if Nature was
holding her breath for a moment before giving
voice to an explosion of sound. I sensed
impending disaster of some sort. What it
was I could not guess, but was convinced that
something was about to happen.</p>

<p>As I held my breath and listened, the ranch
house was silent; even Pete had not, apparently,
awakened, but I could not hear his regular
breathing. Now I thought I could detect
a soft and very faint noise as of some large
body creeping over the puncheon steps. I also
imagined I detected the noise of padded
feet and the scraping noise of claws on the
wood. A shudder ran through me. Was a
panther, a mountain lion, about to spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
upon me? No, I abandoned the thought
and instinctively I knew that it must be one
of the black wolf pack. Then I remembered
hearing the cracking and breaking of sticks
or timber while I was trying to sleep in the
bedroom, and I felt that Pluto had broken out
of the pen and was creeping up on us slowly
and stealthily as I have seen a fox creep up on
a covey of quail.</p>

<p>Would the beast presently hurl its terrible
form upon me, or on Big Pete? I attempted
to warn my friend, but my tongue clung to
the roof of my mouth and for the moment I
was powerless and speechless, subdued by a
combination of fear of the real beast and
superstitious fear of the fabulous werwolf
or loup-garou,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but the next moment I pulled
myself together, mastered my trembling limbs,
rolled softly out of my blankets, and gun in
hand wormed my way toward the spot where
Big Pete lay, determined to sell my life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>dearly. With Big Pete beside me, now that
I was thoroughly awake, I would fight all
the werwolves of the old world and all the
loup-garous of Canada. I reached out and
felt for Pete but he was not there, the blankets
were empty; once or twice I thought I detected
the glint of the wolves&#8217; eyes, but the
night was very dark and in the shadow of
the roof I could really see nothing.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> A werwolf, or loup-garou, is a legendary man who, it was formerly
believed, could at will take on the form and nature of a wolf.</p></div>

<p>Closer and closer sounded the stealthy,
dragging noise, and I heard a hand feel softly
for the latch of the front door and could hear
fingers scraping ever so softly over the wood
surface of the other side. A slight rattle
told me that the hand had found the latch
and that presently the door would be flung
open. With my revolver ready I waited
developments and braced myself for the
attack.</p>

<p>The door flew open wide, and the voice of
the Wild Hunter cried,</p>

<p>&#8220;Pluto, you fiend, down! down! I say!&#8221;</p>

<p>But this time the huge brute did not obey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and the command was answered by a low
rebellious growl, a scratching of feet on the
puncheons, and a heavy thud of someone
falling told me that the final struggle for the
leadership of the black wolf pack had begun.</p>

<p>Then burst upon the stillness of the night
such an uproar that for a moment I thought
the whole pack was mixed in the fight, but
at length I heard Pluto&#8217;s snarling, rumbling
growl, answered by the distant howl of the
wolf pack, followed immediately by a close-by
yell that chilled my blood; after this came
Big Pete&#8217;s war cry, then the crash of falling
objects, shrieks and growls and savage yells.</p>

<p>I had flung myself forward, and there in the
pitch darkness of the doorway of the hall I
felt and heard rather than saw the lean twisting
bodies of the Wild Hunter and Pluto
clasped in a life and death struggle on the
floor. I feared to use my revolver, as it would
have been impossible to tell whether I was
shooting the hunter or the wolf.</p>

<p>Suddenly a light burst upon the scene.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Big Pete&#8217;s absence was explained; he had
secured a lantern and holding it aloft with his
left hand, with a six-shooter in his right, he
paused a moment over the struggling figures.
By the light of the lantern one could see that
the Wild Hunter was on his back struggling
with the giant beast which he was trying to
choke with his two hands, while the wolf&#8217;s
teeth were seeking the throat of the man. It
was a terrible scene but it was no time to waste
in horror. The efforts of the hunter to free
himself from his terrible assailant would have
been of little avail but for the assistance
of Big Pete, for the wolf was shaking the wild
man from side to side with terrific force,
very much the same as a bull-terrier might
shake a cat.</p>

<p>Pete wasted no time but placing the muzzle
of his gun against the wolf&#8217;s head he fired,
then shouted to me, &#8220;Look behind you.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I wheeled about I found that I was facing
the rest of the pack. Pluto reared upon his
hind legs, clawed the air frantically in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
death struggle, and fell with a thud across
his master&#8217;s body, but Pete and I were now
concentrating our fire on the snarling, leaping
bodies of the wolf pack. Fortunately the
death of Pluto and the silence of the Wild
Hunter seemed to discourage the pack, they
evidently missed their leaders and this gave
us the advantage, for if they had rushed us we
undoubtedly would have fallen victims to
their savage teeth.</p>

<p>In the melee the lantern was upset and the
struggle ended in darkness as it began, but
when things quieted down and Pete relit the
lantern there were only two wolves which
were alive and they were fiercely attacking
each other. We soon dispatched them, however,
and then devoted our attention to the
Wild Hunter over whose body Big Pete was
now bending.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the great horn spoon, Le-loo!&#8221; cried
he, looking up for a moment, &#8220;we&#8217;ve wiped out
the pack, and now that the scrap is over here
comes the Injuns. I calculate our friend here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
is a dead one; Pluto has chewed him to pieces.
Come, lend a hand and we will see what we
can do for the poor old man; he certainly did
put up a glorious fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reaching down I gathered the old man&#8217;s
legs in my arms, and with Big Pete supporting
his head and shoulders, we carried him into
my room and laid him on the feather bed
under the savagely ornamented tester.</p>

<p>Big Pete was all action then, and I helped
as best I could. The Scout ripped one of the
homespun sheets into ribbons and with these
made bandages and proceeded to stay the
flow of blood from the old man&#8217;s lacerated
throat. He worked hard and long and now
and then he would shake his head dubiously.
Presently he muttered, &#8220;&#8217;Taint much use,
Ol&#8217; Timer, I guess yore a goner. Yore goneta
pass over t&#8217; Divide this time, I guess. That
tha&#8217; Pluto fiend done chewed you up fer
further orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the old man opened his eyes, and a
grim smile wrinkled his now ashen face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>&#8220;I knew he&#8217;d do it some day, and I think
he got me this time. The Mewan Indians
call the giant wolf &#8220;Too-le-ze&#8221; and that is also
the name they gave me, but I am not a werwolf,
a loup-garou or a Too-le-ze. I was only
their master but now their victim.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feared that Pluto, as I call him, or Too-le-ze,
was strong and treacherous and that
is why I ruled him with an iron hand. He&#8217;s
got me this time. I guess it had to end this
way&mdash;give me a cup of water.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then fixed his gaze on me and I noticed
that he no longer had that worried, haunted
look which had heretofore characterized him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are Donald&#8217;s son&mdash;well, when I
heard Pluto stalking you I knew that it was
you or your uncle that the beast would get;
it was fate that made me slip and fall, and
once down the wolf saw his long-looked-for
opportunity and instantly availed himself of it.
But the good Lord was not going to allow me
to bring bad luck to both you and your father,
boy. Yes, I am Fay Mullen and I caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the death of your father, and my brother.
I bear the brand of Cain.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were crossing a steep bank of snow at
the foot of a cliff, and being both tired and
hungry we were bickering and quarreling over
nothing. I should have remembered that
your father was but just recovering from an
attack of nervous prostration, but I did not;
we had been months in the mountains prospecting
and the unprofitable toil and loneliness
must have got on my nerves. At any rate,
after some hot, unbrotherly language, we
agreed to part company.</p>

<p>&#8220;We sat down on the snow and divided our
outfit by lot. I got the flint-lock Patrick
Mullen, the fierce Great Dane and the gentle
little donkey; your father got the packhorse
and the Winchester rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&mdash;we&mdash;parted without saying good-bye,
and just then an elk came out on the snow
bank. Instantly your father fired and I fired,
the elk fell, but the simultaneous concussion
of the reports of the two rifles started the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
snow to moving. The Great Dane and the
donkey sensed the danger and fled to the
right. I turned to warn your father and
motioned him back, but he came on a run
toward me and I fled at the heels of my outfit.
The burro and dog escaped to safety, I was
caught in the edge of the slide, knocked unconscious
and buried in snow, from which the
dog rescued me.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fragment of stone struck me on the head
and I have never been the same since then.
Your father and his outfit are buried under
five hundred feet of snow and rocks. I camped
nearby for days but could find no trace of my
brother and all the time a voice seemed to cry,
&#8216;You killed your brother; you are marked
with the brand of Cain.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;This thought has haunted me night and day
and I have never quarreled with a man since
then; for fear that I might do so, I have
avoided white men ever since and buried
myself in these mountains. I found this
valley and I hid here and with the aid of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Great Dane and the wolf dogs I bred, as
beasts of burden, I built this ranch. I&mdash;I&mdash;was
afraid&mdash;all the time, though&mdash;afraid someone
would&mdash;find out about&mdash;Donald&#8217;s death
and blame it on me. When you&mdash;said&mdash;you&mdash;were&mdash;Donald&#8217;s
son I was frightened&mdash;I
thought you&#8217;d come to get me&mdash;for killing
your&mdash;father and&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I was going to kill
myself. But Pluto got&mdash;me&mdash;and saved me
from further guilt. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He said more, but neither Big Pete nor I
could understand him. Indeed, he kept mumbling
incoherently for an hour or more while
we watched over him and did all that we could
to make him comfortable until the death
rattle in his throat put an end to his mumbling.
But despite our efforts, he passed on at dawn.
Just as the first warm light of the sun glowed
above the mountains, he breathed his last.</p>


<p class="newsection">Now you know why my private den is just
cram full of the things you fellows like. You
may also guess where I procured the black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
wolfskin rugs and the rare bead and porcupine
quill decorations. Yes, that long-barrelled
rifle hanging on the buckhorn rack
is the famous Patrick Mullen gun. It is a
rifle that Washington, Boone or Crockett would
have almost given their scalps to possess,
because it is the same pattern as the ones
they themselves used but more scientifically
and skillfully made. It&#8217;s a flint-lock, too, and
that is the funny part about it that interests
all the Scouts of our Troop. It is my good-turn
mascot, for as long as it hangs there I am
under the influence of my wild uncle and can
quarrel with no man.</p>

<p>Now you know why the gun is preserved
as a trophy for my old Scouts and is an object
of veneration upon which they love to gaze
when they sit cross-legged on the skins of the
black wolf pack before the crackling fire of
their Scoutmaster&#8217;s private den.</p>

<p>Big Pete? Oh, he now runs the Pluto
Ranch in Paradise Valley.</p>
